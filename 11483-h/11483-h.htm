    <p>
      It is with no undue confidence that I have accepted the
      invitation of the brothers and sisters of Lewis Carroll to
      write this Memoir. I am well aware that the path of the
      biographer is beset with pitfalls, and that, for him,
      <i>suppressio veri</i> is almost necessarily <i>suggestio
      falsi</i>&mdash;the least omission may distort the whole picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      To write the life of Lewis Carroll as it should be written
      would tax the powers of a man of far greater experience and
      insight than I have any pretension to possess, and even he
      would probably fail to represent adequately such a complex
      personality. At least I have done my best to justify their
      choice, and if in any way I have wronged my uncle's memory,
      unintentionally, I trust that my readers will pardon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My task has been a delightful one. Intimately as I thought
      I knew Mr. Dodgson during his life, I seem since his death
      to have become still better acquainted with him. If this
      Memoir helps others of his admirers to a fuller knowledge
      of a man whom to know was to love, I shall not have written
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take this opportunity of thanking those who have so
      kindly assisted me in my work, and first I must mention my
      old schoolmaster, the Rev. Watson Hagger, M.A., to whom my
      readers are indebted for the portions of this book dealing
      with Mr. Dodgson's mathematical works. I am greatly
      indebted to Mr. Dodgson's relatives, and to all those kind
      friends of his and others who have aided me, in so many
      ways, in my difficult task. In particular, I may mention
      the names of H.R.H. the Duchess of Albany; Miss Dora Abdy;
      Mrs. Egerton Allen; Rev. F. H. Atkinson; Sir G.
      Baden-Powell, M.P.; Mr. A. Ball; Rev. T. Vere Bayne; Mrs.
      Bennie; Miss Blakemore; the Misses Bowman; Mrs. Boyes; Mrs.
      Bremer; Mrs. Brine; Miss Mary Brown; Mrs. Calverley; Miss
      Gertrude Chataway; Mrs. Chester; Mr. J. C. Cropper; Mr.
      Robert Davies; Miss Decima Dodgson; the Misses Dymes; Mrs.
      Eschwege; Mrs. Fuller; Mr. Harry Furniss; Rev. C. A.
      Goodhart; Mrs. Hargreaves; Miss Rose Harrison; Mr. Henry
      Holiday; Rev. H. Hopley; Miss Florence Jackson; Rev. A.
      Kingston; Mrs. Kitchin; Mrs. Freiligrath Kroeker; Mr. F.
      Madan; Mrs. Maitland; Miss M. E. Manners; Miss Adelaide
      Paine; Mrs. Porter; Miss Edith Rix; Rev. C. J. Robinson,
      D.D.; Mr. S. Rogers; Mrs. Round; Miss Isabel Standen; Mr.
      L. Sergeant; Miss Gaynor Simpson; Mrs. Southwall; Sir John
      Tenniel; Miss E. Gertrude Thomson; Mrs. Woodhouse; and Mrs.
      Wyper.
    </p>
    <p>
      For their help in the work of compiling the Bibliographical
      chapter and some other parts of the book, my thanks are due
      to Mr. E. Baxter, Oxford; the Controller of the University
      Press, Oxford; Mr. A. J. Lawrence, Rugby; Messrs. Macmillan
      and Co., London; Mr. James Parker, Oxford; and Messrs.
      Ward, Lock and Co., London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the extracts which I have given from Mr. Dodgson's
      Journal and Correspondence it will be noticed that Italics
      have been somewhat freely employed to represent the words
      which he underlined. The use of Italics was so marked a
      feature of his literary style, as any one who has read his
      books must have observed, that without their aid the
      rhetorical effect, which he always strove to produce, would
      have been seriously marred.

    <p>
      The Dodgsons appear to have been for a long time connected
      with the north of England, and until quite recently a
      branch of the family resided at Stubb Hall, near Barnard
      Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of the last century a certain Rev.
      Christopher Dodgson held a living in Yorkshire. His son,
      Charles, also took Holy Orders, and was for some time tutor
      to a son of the then Duke of Northumberland. In 1762 his
      patron presented him to the living of Elsdon, in
      Northumberland, by no means a desirable cure, as Mr.
      Dodgson discovered. The following extracts from his letters
      to various members of the Percy family are interesting as
      giving some idea of the life of a rural clergyman a hundred
      years ago:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am obliged to you for promising to write to me, but don't
      give yourself the trouble of writing to this place, for
      'tis almost impossible to receive 'em, without sending a
      messenger 16 miles to fetch 'em.<br>
      <br>
      'Tis impossible to describe the oddity of my situation at
      present, which, however, is not void of some pleasant
      circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      A clogmaker combs out my wig upon my curate's head, by way
      of a block, and his wife powders it with a
      dredging-box.<br>
      <br>
      The vestibule of the castle (used as a temporary parsonage)
      is a low stable; above it the kitchen, in which are two
      little beds joining to each other. The curate and his wife
      lay in one, and Margery the maid in the other. I lay in the
      parlour between two beds to keep me from being frozen to
      death, for as we keep open house the winds enter from every
      quarter, and are apt to sweep into bed to me.<br>
      <br>
      Elsdon was once a market town as some say, and a city
      according to others; but as the annals of the parish were
      lost several centuries ago, it is impossible to determine
      what age it was either the one or the other.<br>
      <br>
      There are not the least traces of the former grandeur to be
      found, whence some antiquaries are apt to believe that it
      lost both its trade and charter at the Deluge.<br>
      <br>
      ... There is a very good understanding between the parties
      [he is speaking of the Churchmen and Presbyterians who
      lived in the parish], for they not only intermarry with one
      another, but frequently do penance together in a white
      sheet, with a white wand, barefoot, and in the coldest
      season of the year. I have not finished the description for
      fear of bringing on a fit of the ague. Indeed, the ideas of
      sensation are sufficient to starve a man to death, without
      having recourse to those of reflection.<br>
      <br>
      If I was not assured by the best authority on earth that
      the world is to be destroyed by fire, I should conclude
      that the day of destruction is at hand, but brought on by
      means of an agent very opposite to that of heat.<br>
      <br>
      I have lost the use of everything but my reason, though my
      head is entrenched in three night-caps, and my throat,
      which is very bad, is fortified by a pair of stockings
      twisted in the form of a cravat.<br>
      <br>
      As washing is very cheap, I wear <i>two</i> shirts at a
      time, and, for want of a wardrobe, I hang my great coat
      upon my own back, and generally keep on my boots in
      imitation of my namesake of Sweden. Indeed, since the snow
      became two feet deep (as I wanted a 'chaappin of Yale' from
      the public-house), I made an offer of them to Margery the
      maid, but her legs are too thick to make use of them, and I
      am told that the greater part of my parishioners are not
      less substantial, and notwithstanding this they are
      remarkable for agility.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In course of time this Mr. Dodgson became Bishop of Ossory
      and Ferns, and he was subsequently translated to the see of
      Elphin. He was warmly congratulated on this change in his
      fortunes by George III., who said that he ought indeed to
      be thankful to have got away from a palace where the
      stabling was so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop had four children, the eldest of whom, Elizabeth
      Anne, married Charles Lutwidge, of Holmrook, in Cumberland.
      Two of the others died almost before they had attained
      manhood. Charles, the eldest son, entered the army, and
      rose to the rank of captain in the 4th Dragoon Guards. He
      met with a sad fate while serving his king and country in
      Ireland. One of the Irish rebels who were supposed to have
      been concerned in the murder of Lord Kilwarden offered to
      give himself up to justice if Captain Dodgson would come
      alone and at night to take him. Though he fully realised
      the risk, the brave captain decided to trust himself to the
      honour of this outlaw, as he felt that no chance should be
      missed of effecting so important a capture. Having first
      written a letter of farewell to his wife, he set out on the
      night of December 16, 1803, accompanied by a few troopers,
      for the meeting-place&mdash;an old hut that stood a mile or so
      from Phillipstown, in King's County. In accordance with the
      terms of the agreement, he left his men a few hundred yards
      from the hut to await his return, and advanced alone
      through the night. A cowardly shot from one of the windows
      of the cottage ended his noble life, and alarmed the
      troopers, who, coming up in haste, were confronted with the
      dead body of their leader. The story is told that on the
      same night his wife heard two shots fired, and made inquiry
      about it, but could find out nothing. Shortly afterwards
      the news came that her husband had been killed just at that
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dodgson left two sons behind him&mdash;Hassard, who,
      after a brilliant career as a special pleader, became a
      Master of the Court of Common Pleas, and Charles, the
      father of the subject of this Memoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles, who was the elder of the two, was born in the year
      1800, at Hamilton, in Lanarkshire. He adopted the clerical
      profession, in which he rose to high honours. He was a
      distinguished scholar, and took a double first at Christ
      Church, Oxford. Although in after life mathematics were his
      favourite pursuit, yet the fact that he translated
      Tertullian for the "Library of the Fathers" is sufficient
      evidence that he made good use of his classical education.
      In the controversy about Baptismal Regeneration he took a
      prominent part, siding on the question with the
      Tractarians, though his views on some other points of
      Church doctrine were less advanced than those of the
      leaders of the Oxford movement. He was a man of deep piety
      and of a somewhat reserved and grave disposition, which,
      however, was tempered by the most generous charity, so that
      he was universally loved by the poor. In moments of
      relaxation his wit and humour were the delight of his
      clerical friends, for he had the rare power of telling
      anecdotes effectively. His reverence for sacred things was
      so great that he was never known to relate a story which
      included a jest upon words from the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1830 he married his cousin, Frances Jane Lutwidge, by
      whom he had eleven children, all of whom, except Lewis
      Carroll, survive. His wife, in the words of one who had the
      best possible opportunities for observing her character,
      was "one of the sweetest and gentlest women that ever
      lived, whom to know was to love. The earnestness of her
      simple faith and love shone forth in all she did and said;
      she seemed to live always in the conscious presence of God.
      It has been said by her children that they never in all
      their lives remember to have heard an impatient or harsh
      word from her lips." It is easy to trace in Lewis Carroll's
      character the influence of that most gentle of mothers;
      though dead she still speaks to us in some of the most
      beautiful and touching passages of his works. Not so long
      ago I had a conversation with an old friend of his; one of
      the first things she said to me was, "Tell me about his
      mother." I complied with her request as well as I was able,
      and, when I had finished my account of Mrs. Dodgson's
      beautiful character, she said, "Ah, I knew it must have
      been so; I felt sure he must have had a good mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 27, 1832, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was born at
      Daresbury, of which parish his father was then incumbent.
      The village of Daresbury is about seven miles from
      Warrington; its name is supposed to be derived from a word
      meaning oak, and certainly oaks are very plentiful in the
      neighbourhood. A canal passes through an outlying part of
      the parish. The bargemen who frequented this canal were a
      special object of Mr. Dodgson's pastoral care. Once, when
      walking with Lord Francis Egerton, who was a large
      landowner in the district, he spoke of his desire to
      provide some sort of religious privileges for them. "If I
      only had &#163;100," he said, "I would turn one of those
      barges into a chapel," and, at his companion's request, he
      described exactly how he would have the chapel constructed
      and furnished. A few weeks later he received a letter from
      Lord Francis to tell him that his wish was fulfilled, and
      that the chapel was ready. In this strange church, which is
      believed to have been the first of its kind, Mr. Dodgson
      conducted service and preached every Sunday evening!

      The parsonage is situated a mile and a half from the
      village, on the glebe-farm, having been erected by a former
      incumbent, who, it was said, cared more for the glebe than
      the parish. Here it was that Charles spent the first eleven
      years of his life&mdash;years of complete seclusion from the
      world, for even the passing of a cart was a matter of great
      interest to the children.

      In this quiet home the boy invented the strangest
      diversions for himself; he made pets of the most odd and
      unlikely animals, and numbered certain snails and toads
      among his intimate friends. He tried also to encourage
      civilised warfare among earthworms, by supplying them with
      small pieces of pipe, with which they might fight if so
      disposed. His notions of charity at this early age were
      somewhat rudimentary; he used to peel rushes with the idea
      that the pith would afterwards "be given to the poor,"
      though what possible use they could put it to he never
      attempted to explain. Indeed he seems at this time to have
      actually lived in that charming "Wonderland" which he
      afterwards described so vividly; but for all that he was a
      thorough boy, and loved to climb the trees and to scramble
      about in the old marl-pits.

    <p>
      One of the few breaks in this very uneventful life was a
      holiday spent with the other members of his family in
      Beaumaris. The journey took three days each way, for
      railroads were then almost unknown; and whatever advantages
      coaching may have had over travelling in trains, speed was
      certainly not one of them.

      Mr. Dodgson from the first used to take an active part in
      his son's education, and the following anecdote will show
      that he had at least a pupil who was anxious to learn. One
      day, when Charles was a very small boy, he came up to his
      father and showed him a book of logarithms, with the
      request, "Please explain." Mr. Dodgson told him that he was
      much too young to understand anything about such a
      difficult subject. The child listened to what his father
      said, and appeared to think it irrelevant, for he still
      insisted, "<i>But</i>, please, explain!"

      On one occasion Mr. and Mrs. Dodgson went to Hull, to pay a
      visit to the latter's father, who had been seriously ill.
      From Hull Mrs. Dodgson wrote to Charles, and he set much
      store by this letter, which was probably one of the first
      he had received. He was afraid that some of his little
      sisters would mess it, or tear it up, so he wrote upon the
      back, "No one is to touch this note, for it belongs to C.
      L. D."; but, this warning appearing insufficient, he added,
      "Covered with slimy pitch, so that they will wet their
      fingers." The precious letter ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dearest Charlie, I have used you rather ill in not
      having written to you sooner, but I know you will forgive
      me, as your Grandpapa has liked to have me with him so
      much, and I could not write and talk to him comfortably.
      All your notes have delighted me, my precious children, and
      show me that you have not quite forgotten me. I am always
      thinking of you, and longing to have you all round me again
      more than words can tell. God grant that we may find you
      all well and happy on Friday evening. I am happy to say
      your dearest Papa is quite well&mdash;his cough is rather
      <i>tickling</i>, but is of no consequence. It delights me,
      my darling Charlie, to hear that you are getting on so well
      with your Latin, and that you make so few mistakes in your
      Exercises. You will be happy to hear that your dearest
      Grandpapa is going on nicely&mdash;indeed I hope he will soon be
      quite well again. He talks a great deal and most kindly
      about you all. I hope my sweetest Will says "Mama"
      sometimes, and that precious Tish has not forgotten. Give
      them and all my other treasures, including yourself,
      1,000,000,000 kisses from me, with my most affectionate
      love. I am sending you a shabby note, but I cannot help it.
      Give my kindest love to Aunt Dar, and believe me, my own
      dearest Charlie, to be your sincerely affectionate<br>
      <br>
      MAMA.

      Among the few visitors who disturbed the repose of
      Daresbury Parsonage was Mr. Durnford, afterwards Bishop of
      Chichester, with whom Mr. Dodgson had formed a close
      friendship. Another was Mr. Bayne, at that time head-master
      of Warrington Grammar School, who used occasionally to
      assist in the services at Daresbury. His son, Vere, was
      Charles's playfellow; he is now a student of Christ Church,
      and the friendship between him and Lewis Carroll lasted
      without interruption till the death of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of his birthplace did not soon fade from
      Charles's mind; long afterwards he retained pleasant
      recollections of its rustic beauty. For instance, his poem
      of "The Three Sunsets," which first appeared in 1860 in
      <i>All the Year Round,</i> begins with the following
      stanzas, which have been slightly altered in later
      editions:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I watch the drowsy night expire,<br>
      And Fancy paints at my desire<br>
      Her magic pictures in the fire.<br>
      <br>
      An island farm, 'mid seas of corn,<br>
      Swayed by the wandering breath of morn,<br>
      The happy spot where I was born.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Though nearly all Mr. Dodgson's parishioners at Daresbury
      have passed away, yet there are still some few left who
      speak with loving reverence of him whose lips, now long
      silenced, used to speak so kindly to them; whose hands,
      long folded in sleep, were once so ready to alleviate their
      wants and sorrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1843 Sir Robert Peel presented him to the Crown living
      of Croft, a Yorkshire village about three miles south of
      Darlington. This preferment made a great change in the life
      of the family; it opened for them many more social
      opportunities, and put an end to that life of seclusion
      which, however beneficial it may be for a short time, is
      apt, if continued too long, to have a cramping and
      narrowing influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river Tees is at Croft the dividing line between
      Yorkshire and Durham, and on the middle of the bridge which
      there crosses it is a stone which shows where the one
      county ends and the other begins. "Certain lands are held
      in this place," says Lewis in his "Topographical
      Dictionary," "by the owner presenting on the bridge, at the
      coming of every new Bishop of Durham, an old sword,
      pronouncing a legendary address, and delivering the sword
      to the Bishop, who returns it immediately." The Tees is
      subject to extraordinary floods, and though Croft Church
      stands many feet above the ordinary level of the river, and
      is separated from it by the churchyard and a field, yet on
      one occasion the church itself was flooded, as was attested
      by water-marks on the old woodwork several feet from the
      floor, still to be seen when Mr. Dodgson was incumbent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This church, which is dedicated to St. Peter, is a quaint
      old building with a Norman porch, the rest of it being of
      more modern construction. It contains a raised pew, which
      is approached by a winding flight of stairs, and is covered
      in, so that it resembles nothing so much as a four-post
      bedstead. This pew used to belong to the Milbanke family,
      with which Lord Byron was connected. Mr. Dodgson found the
      chancel-roof in so bad a state of repair that he was
      obliged to take it down, and replace it by an entirely new
      one. The only village school that existed when he came to
      the place was a sort of barn, which stood in a corner of
      the churchyard. During his incumbency a fine school-house
      was erected. Several members of his family used regularly
      to help in teaching the children, and excellent reports
      were obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rectory is close to the church, and stands in the
      middle of a beautiful garden. The former incumbent had been
      an enthusiastic horticulturist, and the walls of the
      kitchen garden were covered with luxuriant fruit-trees,
      while the greenhouses were well stocked with rare and
      beautiful exotics. Among these was a specimen of that
      fantastic cactus, the night-blowing Cereus, whose flowers,
      after an existence of but a few hours, fade with the waning
      sun. On the day when this occurred large numbers of people
      used to obtain Mr. Dodgson's leave to see the curiosity.

      Near the Rectory is a fine hotel, built when Croft was an
      important posting-station for the coaches between London
      and Edinburgh, but in Mr. Dodgson's time chiefly used by
      gentlemen who stayed there during the hunting season. The
      village is renowned for its baths and medicinal waters. The
      parish of Croft includes the outlying hamlets of Halnaby,
      Dalton, and Stapleton, so that the Rector's position is by
      no means a sinecure. Within the village is Croft Hall, the
      old seat of the Chaytors; but during Mr. Dodgson's
      incumbency the then Sir William Chaytor built and lived at
      Clervaux Castle, calling it by an old family name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after accepting the living of Croft, Mr. Dodgson
      was appointed examining chaplain to the Bishop of Ripon;
      subsequently he was made Archdeacon of Richmond and one of
      the Canons of Ripon Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles was at this time very fond of inventing games for
      the amusement of his brothers and sisters; he constructed a
      rude train out of a wheelbarrow, a barrel and a small
      truck, which used to convey passengers from one "station"
      in the Rectory garden to another. At each of these stations
      there was a refreshment-room, and the passengers had to
      purchase tickets from him before they could enjoy their
      ride. The boy was also a clever conjuror, and, arrayed in a
      brown wig and a long white robe, used to cause no little
      wonder to his audience by his sleight-of-hand. With the
      assistance of various members of the family and the village
      carpenter, he made a troupe of marionettes and a small
      theatre for them to act in. He wrote all the plays himself
      the most popular being "The Tragedy of King John"&mdash;and he
      was very clever at manipulating the innumerable strings by
      which the movements of his puppets were regulated. One
      winter, when the snow lay thick upon the lawn, he traced
      upon it a maze of such hopeless intricacy as almost to put
      its famous rival at Hampton Court in the shade.

      When he was twelve years old his father sent him to school
      at Richmond, under Mr. Tate, a worthy son of that
      well-known Dr. Tate who had made Richmond School so famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am able to give his earliest impressions of school-life
      in his own words, for one of his first letters home has
      been fortunately preserved. It is dated August 5th, and is
      addressed to his two eldest sisters. A boy who has
      <i>ten</i> brothers and sisters can scarcely be expected to
      write separate letters to each of them.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Fanny and Memy,&mdash;I hope you are all getting on well,
      as also the sweet twins, the boys I think that I like the
      best, are Harry Austin, and all the Tates of which there
      are 7 besides a little girl who came down to dinner the
      first day, but not since, and I also like Edmund Tremlet,
      and William and Edward Swire, Tremlet is a sharp little
      fellow about 7 years old, the youngest in the school, I
      also like Kemp and Mawley. The rest of the boys that I know
      are Bertram, Harry and Dick Wilson, and two Robinsons, I
      will tell you all about them when I return. The boys have
      played two tricks upon me which were these&mdash;they first
      proposed to play at "King of the Cobblers" and asked if I
      would be king, to which I agreed. Then they made me sit
      down and sat (on the ground) in a circle round me, and told
      me to say "Go to work" which I said, and they immediately
      began kicking me and knocking me on all sides. The next
      game they proposed was "Peter, the red lion," and they made
      a mark on a tombstone (for we were playing in the
      churchyard) and one of the boys walked with his eyes shut,
      holding out his finger, trying to touch the mark; then a
      little boy came forward to lead the rest and led a good
      many very near the mark; at last it was my turn; they told
      me to shut my eyes well, and the next minute I had my
      finger in the mouth of one of the boys, who had stood (I
      believe) before the tombstone with his mouth open. For 2
      nights I slept alone, and for the rest of the time with Ned
      Swire. The boys play me no tricks now. The only fault (tell
      Mama) that there has been was coming in one day to dinner
      just after grace. On Sunday we went to church in the
      morning, and sat in a large pew with Mr. Fielding, the
      church we went to is close by Mr. Tate's house, we did not
      go in the afternoon but Mr. Tate read a discourse to the
      boys on the 5th commandment. We went to church again in the
      evening. Papa wished me to tell him all the texts I had
      heard preached upon, please to tell him that I could not
      hear it in the morning nor hardly one sentence of the
      sermon, but the one in the evening was I Cor. i. 23. I
      believe it was a farewell sermon, but I am not sure. Mrs.
      Tate has looked through my clothes and left in the trunk a
      great many that will not be wanted. I have had 3
      misfortunes in my clothes etc. 1st, I cannot find my
      tooth-brush, so that I have not brushed my teeth for 3 or 4
      days, 2nd, I cannot find my blotting paper, and 3rd, I have
      no shoe-horn. The chief games are, football, wrestling,
      leap frog, and fighting. Excuse bad writing.<br>
      <br>
      Yr affec' brother Charles.

    <blockquote>
      <i>To</i> SKEFF [<i>a younger brother, aged six</i>].<br>

    <p>
      The discomforts which he, as a "new boy," had to put up
      with from his school-mates affected him as they do not,
      unfortunately, affect most boys, for in later school days
      he was famous as a champion of the weak and small, while
      every bully had good reason to fear him. Though it is hard
      for those who have only known him as the gentle and
      retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that
      long after he left school his name was remembered as that
      of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a
      righteous cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was the custom at that time, Charles began to compose
      Latin verses at a very early age, his first copy being
      dated November 25, 1844. The subject was evening, and this
      is how he treated it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Phoebus aqua splendet descendens, &#230;quora tingens<br>
      Splendore aurato. Pervenit umbra solo.<br>
      Mortales lectos qu&#230;runt, et membra relaxant<br>
      Fessa labore dies; cuncta per orbe silet.<br>
      Imperium placidum nunc sumit Phoebe corusca.<br>
      Antris procedunt sanguine ore fer&#230;.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      These lines the boy solemnly copied into his Diary,
      apparently in the most blissful ignorance of the numerous
      mistakes they contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year he wrote a story which appeared in the school
      magazine. It was called "The Unknown One," so it was
      probably of the sensational type in which small boys
      usually revel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Richmond School, as it was in 1844, may not compare
      favourably in every respect with a modern preparatory
      school, where supervision has been so far "reduced to the
      absurd" that the unfortunate masters hardly get a minute to
      themselves from sunrise till long after sunset, yet no
      better or wiser men than those of the school of Mr. Tate
      are now to be found. Nor, I venture to think, are the
      results of the modern system more successful than those of
      the old one. Charles loved his "kind old schoolmaster," as
      he affectionately calls him, and surely to gain the love of
      the boys is the main battle in school-management.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression he made upon his instructors may be gathered
      from the following extracts from Mr. Tate's first report
      upon him:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Sufficient opportunities having been allowed me to draw
      from actual observation an estimate of your son's character
      and abilities, I do not hesitate to express my opinion that
      he possesses, along with other and excellent natural
      endowments, a very uncommon share of genius. Gentle and
      cheerful in his intercourse with others, playful and ready
      in conversation, he is capable of acquirements and
      knowledge far beyond his years, while his reason is so
      clear and so jealous of error, that he will not rest
      satisfied without a most exact solution of whatever appears
      to him obscure. He has passed an excellent examination just
      now in mathematics, exhibiting at times an illustration of
      that love of precise argument, which seems to him
      natural.<br>
      <br>
      I must not omit to set off against these great advantages
      one or two faults, of which the removal as soon as possible
      is desirable, tho' I am prepared to find it a work of time.
      As you are well aware, our young friend, while jealous of
      error, as I said above, where important faith or principles
      are concerned, is exceedingly lenient towards lesser
      frailties&mdash;and, whether in reading aloud or metrical
      composition, frequently sets at nought the notions of
      Virgil or Ovid as to syllabic quantity. He is moreover
      marvellously ingenious in replacing the ordinary inflexions
      of nouns and verbs, as detailed in our grammars, by more
      exact analogies, or convenient forms of his own devising.
      This source of fault will in due time exhaust itself,
      though flowing freely at present.... You may fairly
      anticipate for him a bright career. Allow me, before I
      close, one suggestion which assumes for itself the wisdom
      of experience and the sincerity of the best intention. You
      must not entrust your son with a full knowledge of his
      superiority over other boys. Let him discover this as he
      proceeds. The love of excellence is far beyond the love of
      excelling; and if he should once be bewitched into a mere
      ambition to surpass others I need not urge that the very
      quality of his knowledge would be materially injured, and
      that his character would receive a stain of a more serious
      description still....
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And again, when Charles was leaving Richmond, he wrote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>

      Although his father had been a Westminster boy, Charles
      was, for some reason or other, sent to Rugby. The great
      Arnold, who had, one might almost say, created Rugby
      School, and who certainly had done more for it than all his
      predecessors put together, had gone to his rest, and for
      four years the reins of government had been in the firm
      hands of Dr. Tait, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. He
      was Headmaster during the whole of the time Charles was at
      Rugby, except the last year, during which Dr. Goulburn held
      that office. Charles went up in February, 1846, and he must
      have found his new life a great change from his quiet
      experiences at Richmond. Football was in full swing, and
      one can imagine that to a new boy "Big-side" was not an
      unalloyed delight. Whether he distinguished himself as a
      "dropper," or ever beat the record time in the "Crick" run,
      I do not know. Probably not; his abilities did not lie much
      in the field of athletics. But he got on capitally with his
      work, and seldom returned home without one or more prizes.
      Moreover, he conducted himself so well that he never had to
      enter that dreaded chamber, well known to <i>some</i>
      Rugbeians, which is approached by a staircase that winds up
      a little turret, and wherein are enacted scenes better
      imagined than described.

      A schoolboy's letter home is not, usually, remarkable for
      the intelligence displayed in it; as a rule it merely leads
      up with more or less ingenuity to the inevitable request
      for money contained in the postscript. Some of Charles's
      letters were of a different sort, as the following example
      shows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Yesterday evening I was walking out with a friend of mine
      who attends as mathematical pupil Mr. Smythies the second
      mathematical master; we went up to Mr. Smythies' house, as
      he wanted to speak to him, and he asked us to stop and have
      a glass of wine and some figs. He seems as devoted to his
      duty as Mr. Mayor, and asked me with a smile of delight,
      "Well Dodgson I suppose you're getting well on with your
      mathematics?" He is very clever at them, though not equal
      to Mr. Mayor, as indeed few men are, Papa excepted.... I
      have read the first number of Dickens' new tale, "Davy
      Copperfield." It purports to be his life, and begins with
      his birth and childhood; it seems a poor plot, but some of
      the characters and scenes are good. One of the persons that
      amused me was a Mrs. Gummidge, a wretched melancholy
      person, who is always crying, happen what will, and
      whenever the fire smokes, or other trifling accident
      occurs, makes the remark with great bitterness, and many
      tears, that she is a "lone lorn creetur, and everything
      goes contrairy with her." I have not yet been able to get
      the second volume Macaulay's "England" to read. I have seen
      it however and one passage struck me when seven bishops had
      signed the invitation to the pretender, and King James sent
      for Bishop Compton (who was one of the seven) and asked him
      "whether he or any of his ecclesiastical brethren had
      anything to do with it?" He replied, after a moment's
      thought "I am fully persuaded your majesty, that there is
      not one of my brethren who is not as innocent in the matter
      as myself." This was certainly no actual lie, but
      certainly, as Macaulay says, it was very little different
      from one.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The Mr. Mayor who is mentioned in this letter formed a very
      high opinion of his pupil's ability, for in 1848 he wrote
      to Archdeacon Dodgson: "I have not had a more promising boy
      at his age since I came to Rugby."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Tait speaks no less warmly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;I must not allow your son to leave school
      without expressing to you the very high opinion I entertain
      of him. I fully coincide in Mr. Cotton's estimate both of
      his abilities and upright conduct. His mathematical
      knowledge is great for his age, and I doubt not he will do
      himself credit in classics. As I believe I mentioned to you
      before, his examination for the Divinity prize was one of
      the most creditable exhibitions I have ever seen.<br>
      <br>
      During the whole time of his being in my house, his conduct
      has been excellent.<br>
      <br>
      Believe me to be, My dear Sir,<br>
      <br>
      Yours very faithfully,<br>
      <br>
      A.C. TAIT.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Public school life then was not what it is now; the
      atrocious system then in vogue of setting hundreds of lines
      for the most trifling offences made every day a weariness
      and a hopeless waste of time, while the bad discipline
      which was maintained in the dormitories made even the
      nights intolerable&mdash;especially for the small boys, whose
      beds in winter were denuded of blankets that the bigger
      ones might not feel cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles kept no diary during his time at Rugby; but,
      looking back upon it, he writes in 1855:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      During my stay I made I suppose some progress in learning
      of various kinds, but none of it was done <i>con amore</i>,
      and I spent an incalculable time in writing out
      impositions&mdash;this last I consider one of the chief faults of
      Rugby School. I made some friends there, the most intimate
      being Henry Leigh Bennett (as college acquaintances we find
      fewer common sympathies, and are consequently less
      intimate)&mdash;but I cannot say that I look back upon my life at
      a Public School with any sensations of pleasure, or that
      any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my
      three years again.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When, some years afterwards, he visited Radley School, he
      was much struck by the cubicle system which prevails in the
      dormitories there, and wrote in his Diary, "I can say that
      if I had been thus secure from annoyance at night, the
      hardships of the daily life would have been comparative
      trifles to bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture on page 32 was, I believe, drawn by Charles
      while he was at Rugby in illustration of a letter received
      from one of his sisters. Halnaby, as I have said before,
      was an outlying district of Croft parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his holidays he used to amuse himself by editing
      local magazines. Indeed, they might be called <i>very
      local</i> magazines, as their circulation was confined to
      the inmates of Croft Rectory. The first of these, <i>Useful
      and Instructive Poetry</i>, was written about 1845. It came
      to an untimely end after a six months' run, and was
      followed at varying intervals by several other periodicals,
      equally short-lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1849 or 1850, <i>The Rectory Umbrella</i> began to
      appear. As the editor was by this time seventeen or
      eighteen years old, it was naturally of a more ambitious
      character than any of its precursors. It contained a serial
      story of the most thrilling interest, entitled, "The
      Walking-Stick of Destiny," some meritorious poetry, a few
      humorous essays, and several caricatures of pictures in the
      Vernon Gallery. Three reproductions of these pictures
      follow, with extracts from the <i>Umbrella</i> descriptive
      of them.

      second engraving from the Vernon Gallery. The picture is
      intended, as our readers will perceive, to illustrate the
      evils of homoeopathy.<a name="FNanchor002"></a><a href="#Footnote_002"><sup>[002]</sup></a> This idea is well
      carried out through the whole picture. The thin old lady at
      the head of the table is in the painter's best style; we
      almost fancy we can trace in the eye of the other lady a
      lurking suspicion that her glasses are not really in fault,
      and that the old gentleman has helped her to <i>nothing</i>
      instead of a nonillionth.<a name="FNanchor003"></a><a href="#Footnote_003"><sup>[003]</sup></a> Her companion has
      evidently got an empty glass in his hand; the two children
      in front are admirably managed, and there is a sly smile on
      the footman's face, as if he thoroughly enjoyed either the
      bad news he is bringing or the wrath of his mistress. The
      carpet is executed with that elaborate care for which Mr.
      Herring is so famed, and the picture on the whole is one of
      his best.<br>

      William Smith<a name="FNanchor005"></a><a href="#Footnote_005"><sup>[005]</sup></a> of his life when a
      schoolboy: we transcribe the passage: "One day Bill
      Tomkins<a name="FNanchor006"></a><a href="#Footnote_006"><sup>[006]</sup></a> and I were left alone
      in the house, the old doctor being out; after playing a
      number of pranks Bill laid me a bet of sixpence that I
      wouldn't pour a bottle of ink over the doctor's cat. <i>I
      did it</i>, but at that moment old Muggles came home, and
      caught me by the ear as I attempted to run away. My
      sensations at the moment I shall never forget; <i>on that
      occasion I received my first ear-ring</i>.<a name="FNanchor007"></a><a href="#Footnote_007"><sup>[007]</sup></a> The only remark Bill
      made to me, as he paid me the money afterwards was, 'I say,
      didn't you just howl jolly!'" The engraving is an excellent
      copy of the picture.
    </blockquote><br>
    <p>
      The best thing in the <i>Rectory Umbrella</i> was a parody
      on Lord Macaulay's style in the "Lays of Ancient Rome";
      Charles had a special aptitude for parody, as is evidenced
      by several of the best-known verses in his later books.

      We have traced in the boyhood of Lewis Carroll the
      beginnings of those characteristic traits which afterwards,
      more fully developed, gave him so distinguished a position
      among his contemporaries. We now come to a period of his
      life which is in some respects necessarily less
      interesting. We all have to pass through that painful era
      of self-consciousness which prefaces manhood, that time
      when we feel so deeply, and are so utterly unable to
      express to others, or even to define clearly to ourselves,
      what it is we do feel. The natural freedom of childhood is
      dead within us; the conventional freedom of riper years is
      struggling to birth, and its efforts are sometimes
      ludicrous to an unsympathetic observer. In Lewis Carroll's
      mental attitude during this critical period there was
      always a calm dignity which saved him from these
      absurdities, an undercurrent of consciousness that what
      seemed so great to him was really very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      On May 23, 1850, he matriculated at Christ Church, the
      venerable college which had numbered his father's among
      other illustrious names. A letter from Dr. Jelf, one of the
      canons of Christ Church, to Archdeacon Dodgson, written
      when the former heard that his old friend's son was coming
      up to "the House," contains the following words: "I am sure
      I express the common feeling of all who remember you at
      Christ Church when I say that we shall rejoice to see a son
      of yours worthy to tread in your footsteps."

    <p>
      Lewis Carroll came into residence on January 24, 1851. From
      that day to the hour of his death&mdash;a period of forty-seven
      years&mdash;he belonged to "the House," never leaving it for any
      length of time, becoming almost a part of it. I, for one,
      can hardly imagine it without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though technically "in residence," he had not rooms of his
      own in College during his first term. The "House" was very
      full; and had it not been for one of the tutors, the Rev.
      J. Lew, kindly lending him one of his own rooms, he would
      have had to take lodgings in the town. The first set of
      rooms he occupied was in Peckwater Quadrangle, which is
      annually the scene of a great bonfire on Guy Fawkes' Day,
      and, generally speaking, is not the best place for a
      reading man to live in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the undergraduates dining in hall were
      divided into "messes." Each mess consisted of about half a
      dozen men, who had a table to themselves. Dinner was served
      at five, and very indifferently served, too; the dishes and
      plates were of pewter, and the joint was passed round, each
      man cutting off what he wanted for himself. In Mr.
      Dodgson's mess were Philip Pusey, the late Rev. G. C.
      Woodhouse, and, among others, one who still lives in "Alice
      in Wonderland" as the "Hatter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few days after term began, Mrs. Dodgson died
      suddenly at Croft. The shock was a terrible one to the
      whole family, and especially to her devoted husband. I have
      come across a delightful and most characteristic letter
      from Dr. Pusey&mdash;a letter full of the kindest and truest
      sympathy with the Archdeacon in his bereavement. The part
      of it which bears upon Mrs. Dodgson's death I give in
      full:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Friend, I hear and see so little and so few
      persons, that I had not heard of your sorrow until your
      to-day's letter; and now I but guess what it was: only your
      language is that of the very deepest. I have often thought,
      since I had to think of this, how, in all adversity, what
      God takes away He may give us back with increase. One
      cannot think that any holy earthly love will cease, when we
      shall "be like the Angels of God in Heaven." Love here must
      shadow our love there, deeper because spiritual, without
      any alloy from our sinful nature, and in the fulness of the
      love of God. But as we grow here by God's grace will be our
      capacity for endless love. So, then, if by our very
      sufferings we are purified, and our hearts enlarged, we
      shall, in that endless bliss, love more those whom we loved
      here, than if we had never had that sorrow, never been
      parted....

    <p>
      Lewis Carroll was summoned home to attend the funeral&mdash;a sad
      interlude amidst the novel experiences of a first term at
      College. The Oxford of 1851 was in many ways quite unlike
      the Oxford of 1898. The position of the undergraduates was
      much more similar to that of schoolboys than is now the
      case; they were subject to the same penalties&mdash;corporal
      punishment, even, had only just gone out of vogue!&mdash;and were
      expected to work, and to work hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early rising then was strictly enforced, as the following
      extract from one of his letters will show:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am not so anxious as usual to begin my personal history,
      as the first thing I have to record is a very sad incident,
      namely, my missing morning chapel; before, however, you
      condemn me, you must hear how accidental it was. For some
      days now I have been in the habit of, I will not say
      getting up, but of being called at a quarter past six, and
      generally managing to be down soon after seven. In the
      present instance I had been up the night before till about
      half-past twelve, and consequently when I was called I fell
      asleep again, and was thunderstruck to find on waking that
      it was ten minutes past eight. I have had no imposition,
      nor heard anything about it. It is rather vexatious to have
      happened so soon, as I had intended never to be late.

    <p>
      It was therefore obviously his custom to have his breakfast
      <i>before</i> going to chapel. I wonder how many
      undergraduates of the present generation follow the same
      hardy rule! But then no "impositions" threaten the modern

      sluggard, even if he neglects chapel altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Long Vacation he visited the Great Exhibition,
      and wrote his sister Elizabeth a long account of what he
      had seen:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I think the first impression produced on you when you get
      inside is one of bewilderment. It looks like a sort of
      fairyland. As far as you can look in any direction, you see
      nothing but pillars hung about with shawls, carpets,
      &amp;c., with long avenues of statues, fountains, canopies,
      etc., etc., etc. The first thing to be seen on entering is
      the Crystal Fountain, a most elegant one about thirty feet
      high at a rough guess, composed entirely of glass and
      pouring down jets of water from basin to basin; this is in
      the middle of the centre nave, and from it you can look
      down to either end, and up both transepts. The centre of
      the nave mostly consists of a long line of colossal
      statues, some most magnificent. The one considered the
      finest, I believe, is the Amazon and Tiger. She is sitting
      on horseback, and a tiger has fastened on the neck of the
      horse in front. You have to go to one side to see her face,
      and the other to see the horse's. The horse's face is
      really wonderful, expressing terror and pain so exactly,
      that you almost expect to hear it scream.... There are some
      very ingenious pieces of mechanism. A tree (in the French
      Compartment) with birds chirping and hopping from branch to
      branch exactly like life. The bird jumps across, turns
      round on the other branch, so as to face back again,
      settles its head and neck, and then in a few moments jumps
      back again. A bird standing at the foot of the tree trying
      to eat a beetle is rather a failure; it never succeeds in
      getting its head more than a quarter of an inch down, and
      that in uncomfortable little jerks, as if it was choking. I
      have to go to the Royal Academy, so must stop: as the
      subject is quite inexhaustible, there is no hope of ever
      coming to a regular finish.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On November 1st he won a Boulter scholarship, and at the
      end of the following year obtained First Class Honours in
      Mathematics and a Second in Classical Moderations. On
      Christmas Eve he was made a Student on Dr. Pusey's
      nomination, for at that time the Dean and Canons nominated
      to Studentships by turn. The only conditions on which these
      old Studentships were held were that the Student should
      remain unmarried, and should proceed to Holy Orders. No
      statute precisely defined what work was expected of them,
      that question being largely left to their own discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight Students at the bottom of the list that is to
      say, the eight who had been nominated last&mdash;had to mark, by
      pricking on weekly papers called "the Bills," the
      attendance at morning and evening chapel. They were allowed
      to arrange this duty among themselves, and, if it was
      neglected, they were all punished. This long&mdash;defunct custom
      explains an entry in Lewis Carroll's Diary for October 15,
      1853, "Found I had got the prickbills two hundred lines
      apiece, by not pricking in in the morning," which, I must
      confess, mystified me exceedingly at first. Another
      reference to College impositions occurs further on in his
      Diary, at a time when he was a Lecturer: "Spoke to the Dean
      about F&mdash;, who has brought an imposition which his tutor
      declares is not his own writing, after being expressly told
      to write it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is an extract from his father's letter of
      congratulation, on his being nominated for the
      Studentship:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dearest Charles,&mdash;The feelings of thankfulness and
      delight with which I have read your letter just received, I
      must leave to <i>your conception</i>; for they are, I
      assure you, beyond <i>my expression</i>; and your
      affectionate heart will derive no small addition of joy
      from thinking of the joy which you have occasioned to me,
      and to all the circle of your home. I say "<i>you</i> have
      occasioned," because, grateful as I am to my old friend Dr.
      Pusey for what he has done, I cannot desire stronger
      evidence than his own words of the fact that you have
      <i>won</i>, and well won, this honour for <i>yourself</i>,
      and that it is bestowed as a matter of <i>justice</i> to
      <i>you</i>, and not of <i>kindness</i> to <i>me</i>. You
      will be interested in reading extracts from his two letters
      to me&mdash;the first written three years ago in answer to one
      from me, in which I distinctly told him that I neither
      asked nor expected that he should serve me in this matter,
      unless my son should fairly reach the standard of merit by
      which these appointments were regulated. In reply he says&mdash;
      "I thank you for the way in which you put the application
      to me. I have now, for nearly twenty years, not given a
      Studentship to any friend of my own, unless there was no
      very eligible person in the College. I have passed by or
      declined the sons of those to whom I was personally
      indebted for kindness. I can only say that I shall have
      <i>very great</i> pleasure, if circumstances permit me to
      nominate your son." In his letter received this morning he
      says&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        "I have great pleasure in telling you that I have been
        enabled to recommend your son for a Studentship this
        Christmas. It must be so much more satisfactory to you
        that he should be nominated thus, in consequence of the
        recommendation of the College. One of the Censors brought
        me to-day five names; but in their minds it was plain
        that they thought your son on the whole the most eligible
        for the College. It has been very satisfactory to hear of
        your son's uniform steady and good conduct."
      </blockquote>The last clause is a parallel to your own
      report, and I am glad that you should have had so soon an
      evidence so substantial of the truth of what I have so
      often inculcated, that it is the "steady, painstaking,
      likely-to-do-good" man, who in the long run wins the race
      against those who now and then give a brilliant flash and,
      as Shakespeare says, "straight are cold again."

        ARCHDEACON DODGSON.</div>


    <p>
      In 1853 Archdeacon Dodgson was collated and installed as
      one of the Canons of Ripon Cathedral. This appointment
      necessitated a residence of three months in every year at
      Ripon, where Dr. Erskine was then Dean. A certain Miss
      Anderson, who used to stay at the Deanery, had very
      remarkable "clairvoyant" powers; she was able&mdash;it was
      averred&mdash;by merely holding in her hand a folded paper
      containing some words written by a person unknown to her,
      to describe his or her character. In this way, at what
      precise date is uncertain, she dictated the following
      description of Lewis Carroll: "Very clever head; a great
      deal of number; a great deal of imitation; he would make a
      good actor; diffident; rather shy in general society; comes
      out in the home circle; rather obstinate; very clever; a
      great deal of concentration; very affectionate; a great
      deal of wit and humour; not much eventuality (or memory of
      events); fond of deep reading; imaginative, fond, of
      reading poetry; <i>may</i> compose." Those who knew him
      well will agree that this was, at any rate, a remarkable
      coincidence.

      Longley, afterwards Primate, was then Bishop of Ripon. His
      charming character endeared him to the Archdeacon and his
      family, as to every one else who saw much of him. He was
      one of the few men whose faces can truly be called
      <i>beautiful</i>; it was a veil through which a soul, all
      gentleness and truth, shone brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of 1854 Mr. Dodgson was reading hard for
      "Greats." For the last three weeks before the examination
      he worked thirteen hours a day, spending the whole night
      before the <i>viva voce</i> over his books. But philosophy
      and history were not very congenial subjects to him, and
      when the list was published his name was only in the third
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the Long Vacation at Whitby, reading Mathematics
      with Professor Price. His work bore good fruit, for in
      October he obtained First Class Honours in the Final
      Mathematical School. "I am getting quite tired of being
      congratulated on various subjects," he writes; "there seems
      to be no end of it. If I had shot the Dean I could hardly
      have had more said about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In another letter dated December 13th, he says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Enclosed you will find a list which I expect you to rejoice
      over considerably; it will take me more than a day to
      believe it, I expect&mdash;I feel at present very like a child
      with a new toy, but I daresay I shall be tired of it soon,
      and wish to be Pope of Rome next.... I have just been to
      Mr. Price to see how I did in the papers, and the result
      will I hope be gratifying to you. The following were the
      sums total for each in the First Class, as nearly as I can
      remember:&mdash;
      <pre>      <tt>
Dodgson   ...   ...   ... 279<br>
Bosanquet ...   ...   ... 261<br>
Cookson  ...   ...   ...  254<br>
Fowler   ...   ...   ...  225<br>
Ranken   ...   ...   ...  213</tt>     <br></pre>He also said he never remembered so good a set of men in.
All this is very satisfactory. I must also add (this is a very
boastful letter) that I ought to get the senior scholarship next
term.... One thing more I will add, to crown all, and that is, I
find I am the next First Class Mathematical Student to Faussett
(with the exception of Kitchin who has given up Mathematics), so
that I stand next (as Bosanquet is going to leave) for the
Lectureship.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On December 18th he took the degree of Bachelor of Arts,
      and on October 15, 1855, he was made a "Master of the
      House," in honour of the appointment of the new Dean (Dr.
      Liddell) who succeeded Dean Gaisford. To be made Master of
      the House means that a man has all the privileges of a
      Master of Arts within the walls of Christ Church. But he
      must be of a certain number of terms' standing, and be
      admitted in due form by the Vice-Chancellor, before he is a
      Master of Arts of the University. In this wider sense Mr.
      Dodgson did not take his Master's degree until 1857.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is anticipating events, and there is much to tell of
      the year 1855, which was a very eventful one for him. On
      February 15th he was made Sub-Librarian. "This will add
      &#163;35 to my income," he writes, "not much towards
      independence." For he was most anxious to have a sufficient
      income to make him his own master, that he might enter on
      the literary and artistic career of which he was already
      dreaming. On May 14th he wrote in his Diary: "The Dean and
      Canons have been pleased to give me one of the Bostock
      scholarships, said to be worth &#163;20 a year&mdash;this very
      nearly raises my income this year to independence.
      Courage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His college work, during 1855, was chiefly taking private
      pupils, but he had, in addition, about three and a half
      hours a day of lecturing during the last term of the year.
      He did not, however, work as one of the regular staff of
      lecturers until the next year. From that date his work
      rapidly increased, and he soon had to devote regularly as
      much as seven hours a day to delivering lectures, to say
      nothing of the time required for preparing them.

      The following extract from his Journal, June 22, 1855, will
      serve to show his early love for the drama. The scene is
      laid at the Princess' Theatre, then at the height of its
      glory:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The evening began with a capital farce, "Away with
      Melancholy," and then came the great play, "Henry VIII.,"
      the greatest theatrical treat I ever had or ever expect to
      have. I had no idea that anything so superb as the scenery
      and dresses was ever to be seen on the stage. Kean was
      magnificent as Cardinal Wolsey, Mrs. Kean a worthy
      successor to Mrs. Siddons as Queen Catherine, and all the
      accessories without exception were good&mdash;but oh, that
      exquisite vision of Queen Catherine's! I almost held my
      breath to watch: the illusion is perfect, and I felt as if
      in a dream all the time it lasted. It was like a delicious
      reverie, or the most beautiful poetry. This is the true end
      and object of acting&mdash;to raise the mind above itself, and
      out of its petty cares. Never shall I forget that wonderful
      evening, that exquisite vision&mdash;sunbeams broke in through
      the roof, and gradually revealed two angel forms, floating
      in front of the carved work on the ceiling: the column of
      sunbeams shone down upon the sleeping queen, and gradually
      down it floated, a troop of angelic forms, transparent, and
      carrying palm branches in their hands: they waved these
      over the sleeping queen, with oh! such a sad and solemn
      grace. So could I fancy (if the thought be not profane)
      would real angels seem to our mortal vision, though
      doubtless our conception is poor and mean to the reality.
      She in an ecstasy raises her arms towards them, and to
      sweet slow music, they vanish as marvellously as they came.
      Then the profound silence of the audience burst at once
      into a rapture of applause; but even that scarcely marred
      the effect of the beautiful sad waking words of the Queen,
      "Spirits of peace, where are ye?" I never enjoyed anything
      so much in my life before; and never felt so inclined to
      shed tears at anything fictitious, save perhaps at that
      poetical gem of Dickens, the death of little Paul.

      The picture on the opposite page is one of Mr. Dodgson's
      illustrations in <i>Misch-Masch,</i> a periodical of the
      nature of <i>The Rectory Umbrella</i>, except that it
      contained printed stories and poems by the editor, cut out
      of the various newspapers to which he had contributed them.
      Of the comic papers of that day <i>Punch,</i> of course,
      held the foremost place, but it was not without rivals;
      there was a certain paper called <i>Diogenes</i>, then very
      near its end, which imitated <i>Punch's</i> style, and in
      1853 the proprietor of <i>The Illustrated News</i>, at that
      time one of the most opulent publishers in London, started
      <i>The Comic Times.</i> A capable editor was found in
      Edmund Yates; "Phiz" and other well-known artists and
      writers joined the staff, and 100,000 copies of the first
      number were printed.

      "Alas! What Boots"<br>
      Milton's Lucidas.</b>
    </div><br>
    <p>
      Among the contributors was Frank Smedley, author of "Frank
      Fairleigh." Though a confirmed invalid, and condemned to
      spend most of his days on a sofa, Mr. Smedley managed to
      write several fine novels, full of the joy of life, and
      free from the least taint of discontent or morbid feeling.
      He was one of those men&mdash;one meets them here and there&mdash;whose
      minds rise high above their bodily infirmities; at moments
      of depression, which come to them as frequently, if not
      more frequently, than to other men, they no doubt feel
      their weakness, and think themselves despised, little
      knowing that we, the stronger ones in body, feel nothing
      but admiration as we watch the splendid victory of the soul
      over its earthly companion which their lives display.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through Frank Smedley that Mr. Dodgson became one of
      the contributors to <i>The Comic Times</i>. Several of his
      poems appeared in it, and Mr. Yates wrote to him in the
      kindest manner, expressing warm approval of them. When
      <i>The Comic Times</i> changed hands in 1856, and was
      reduced to half its size, the whole staff left it and
      started a new venture, <i>The Train</i>. They were joined
      by Sala, whose stories in <i>Household Words</i> were at
      that time usually ascribed by the uninitiated to Charles
      Dickens. Mr. Dodgson's contributions to <i>The Train</i>
      included the following: "Solitude" (March, 1856); "Novelty
      and Romancement" (October, 1856); "The Three Voices"
      (November, 1856); "The Sailor's Wife" (May, 1857); and
      last, but by no means least, "Hiawatha's Photographing"
      (December, 1857). All of these, except "Novelty and
      Romancement," have since been republished in "Rhyme? and
      Reason?" and "Three Sunsets."
    </p>
    <p>
      The last entry in Mr. Dodgson's Diary for this year reads
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am sitting alone in my bedroom this last night of the old
      year, waiting for midnight. It has been the most eventful
      year of my life: I began it a poor bachelor student, with
      no definite plans or expectations; I end it a master and
      tutor in Ch. Ch., with an income of more than &#163;300 a
      year, and the course of mathematical tuition marked out by
      God's providence for at least some years to come. Great
      mercies, great failings, time lost, talents misapplied&mdash;such
      has been the past year.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      His Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself
      and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred
      and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive
      him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the
      future. And all the time that he was thus speaking of
      himself as a sinner, and a man who was utterly falling
      short of his aim, he was living a life full of good deeds
      and innumerable charities, a life of incessant labour and
      unremitting fulfilment of duty. So, I suppose, it is always
      with those who have a really high ideal; the harder they
      try to approach it the more it seems to recede from them,
      or rather, perhaps, it is impossible to be both "the
      subject and spectator" of goodness. As Coventry Patmore
      wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <br>
      Become whatever good you see;<br>
      Nor sigh if, forthwith, fades from view<br>
      The grace of which you may not be<br>
      The Subject and spectator too.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The reading of "Alton Locke" turned his mind towards social
      subjects. "If the book were but a little more definite," he
      writes, "it might stir up many fellow-workers in the same
      good field of social improvement. Oh that God, in His good
      providence, may make me hereafter such a worker! But alas,
      what are the means? Each one has his own <i>nostrum</i> to
      propound, and in the Babel of voices nothing is done. I
      would thankfully spend and be spent so long as I were sure
      of really effecting something by the sacrifice, and not
      merely lying down under the wheels of some irresistible
      Juggernaut."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was for some time the editor of <i>College Rhymes</i>, a
      Christ Church paper, in which his poem, "A Sea Dirge"
      (afterwards republished in "Phantasmagoria," and again in
      "Rhyme? and Reason?"), first appeared. The following verses
      were among his contributions to the same magazine:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <br>
      I painted her a gushing thing,<br>
      With years perhaps a score<br>
      I little thought to find they were<br>
      At least a dozen more;<br>
      My fancy gave her eyes of blue,<br>
      A curly auburn head:<br>
      I came to find the blue a green,<br>
      The auburn turned to red.<br>
      <br>
      She boxed my ears this morning,<br>
      They tingled very much;<br>
      I own that I could wish her<br>
      A somewhat lighter touch;<br>
      And if you were to ask me how<br>
      Her charms might be improved,<br>
      I would not have them <i>added to</i>,<br>
      But just a few <i>removed</i>!<br>
      <br>
      She has the bear's ethereal grace,<br>
      The bland hyena's laugh,<br>
      The footstep of the elephant,<br>
      The neck of the giraffe;<br>
      I love her still, believe me,<br>
      Though my heart its passion hides;<br>
      "She is all my fancy painted her,"<br>
      But oh! <i>how much besides</i>!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was when writing for <i>The Train</i> that he first felt
      the need of a pseudonym. He suggested "Dares" (the first
      syllable of his birthplace) to Edmund Yates, but, as this
      did not meet with his editor's approval, he wrote again,
      giving a choice of four names, (1) Edgar Cuthwellis, (2)
      Edgar U. C. Westhall, (3) Louis Carroll, and (4) Lewis
      Carroll. The first two were formed from the letters of his
      two Christian names, Charles Lutwidge; the others are
      merely variant forms of those names&mdash;Lewis = Ludovicus =
      Lutwidge; Carroll = Carolus = Charles. Mr. Yates chose the
      last, and thenceforward it became Mr. Dodgson's ordinary
      <i>nom de plume</i> . The first occasion on which he used
      it was, I believe, when he wrote "The Path of Roses," a
      poem which appeared in <i>The Train</i> in May, 1856.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 16th he again visited the Princess's Theatre. This
      time the play was "A Winter's Tale," and he "especially
      admired the acting of the little Mamillius, Ellen Terry, a
      beautiful little creature, who played with remarkable ease
      and spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Long Vacation he spent a few weeks in the
      English Lake District. In spite of the rain, of which he
      had his full share, he managed to see a good deal of the
      best scenery, and made the ascent of Gable in the face of
      an icy gale, which laid him up with neuralgia for some
      days. He and his companions returned to Croft by way of
      Barnard Castle, as he narrates in his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We set out by coach for Barnard Castle at about seven, and
      passed over about forty miles of the dreariest hill-country
      I ever saw; the climax of wretchedness was reached in
      Bowes, where yet stands the original of "Dotheboys Hall";
      it has long ceased to be used as a school, and is falling
      into ruin, in which the whole place seems to be following
      its example&mdash;the roofs are falling in, and the windows
      broken or barricaded&mdash;the whole town looks plague-stricken.
      The courtyard of the inn we stopped at was grown over with
      weeds, and a mouthing idiot lolled against the corner of
      the house, like the evil genius of the spot. Next to a
      prison or a lunatic asylum, preserve me from living at
      Bowes!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Although he was anything but a sportsman, he was interested
      in the subject of betting, from a mathematical standpoint
      solely, and in 1857 he sent a letter to <i>Bell's Life</i>,
      explaining a method by which a betting man might ensure
      winning over any race. The system was either to back
      <i>every</i> horse, or to lay against <i>every</i> horse,
      according to the way the odds added up. He showed his
      scheme to a sporting friend, who remarked, "An excellent
      system, and you're bound to win&mdash;<i>if only you can get
      people to take your bets</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same year he made the acquaintance of Tennyson,
      whose writings he had long intensely admired. He thus
      describes the poet's appearance:&mdash;

      A strange shaggy-looking man; his hair, moustache, and
      beard looked wild and neglected; these very much hid the
      character of the face. He was dressed in a loosely fitting
      morning coat, common grey flannel waistcoat and trousers,
      and a carelessly tied black silk neckerchief. His hair is
      black; I think the eyes too; they are keen and
      restless&mdash;nose aquiline&mdash;forehead high and broad&mdash;both face
      and head are fine and manly. His manner was kind and
      friendly from the first; there is a dry lurking humour in
      his style of talking. I took the opportunity [he goes on to
      say] of asking the meaning of two passages in his poems,
      which have always puzzled me: one in "Maud"&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        <br>
        Strange that I hear two men<br>
        Somewhere talking of me;<br>
        Well, if it prove a girl, my boy<br>
        Will have plenty; so let it be.
      </blockquote>He said it referred to Maud, and to the two
      fathers arranging a match between himself and her.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      The other was of the poet&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        <br>
        Dowered with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,<br>
        The love of love.
      </blockquote>He said that he was quite willing it should
      bear any meaning the words would fairly bear; to the best
      of his recollection his meaning when he wrote it was "the
      hate of the quality hate, &amp;c.," but he thought the
      meaning of "the quintessence of hatred" finer. He said
      there had never been a poem so misunderstood by the
      "ninnies of critics" as "Maud."

      During an evening spent at Tent Lodge Tennyson remarked, on
      the similarity of the monkey's skull to the human, that a
      young monkey's skull is quite human in shape, and gradually
      alters&mdash;the analogy being borne out by the human skull being
      at first more like the statues of the gods, and gradually
      degenerating into human; and then, turning to Mrs.
      Tennyson, "There, that's the second original remark I've
      made this evening!" Mr. Dodgson saw a great deal of the
      Tennysons after this, and photographed the poet himself and
      various members of his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October he made the acquaintance of John Ruskin, who in
      after years was always willing to assist him with his
      valuable advice on any point of artistic criticism. Mr.
      Dodgson was singularly fortunate in his friends; whenever
      he was in difficulties on any technical matters, whether of
      religion, law, medicine, art, or whatever it might be, he
      always had some one especially distinguished in that branch
      of study whose aid he could seek as a friend. In
      particular, the names of Canon King (now Bishop of
      Lincoln), and Sir James Paget occur to me; to the latter
      Mr. Dodgson addressed many letters on questions of medicine
      and surgery&mdash;some of them intricate enough, but never too
      intricate to weary the unfailing patience of the great
      surgeon.

      I breakfasted this morning with Fowler of Lincoln to meet
      Thackeray (the author), who delivered his lecture on George
      III. in Oxford last night. I was much pleased with what I
      saw of him; his manner is simple and unaffected; he shows
      no anxiety to shine in conversation, though full of fun and
      anecdote when drawn out. He seemed delighted with the
      reception he had met with last night: the undergraduates
      seem to have behaved with most unusual moderation.

      The next few years of his life passed quietly, and without
      any unusual events to break the monotony of college
      routine. He spent his mornings in the lecture-rooms, his
      afternoons in the country or on the river&mdash;he was very fond
      of boating&mdash;and his evenings in his room, reading and
      preparing for the next day's work. But in spite of all this
      outward calm of life, his mind was very much exercised on
      the subject of taking Holy Orders. Not only was this step
      necessary if he wished to retain his Studentship, but also
      he felt that it would give him much more influence among
      the undergraduates, and thus increase his power of doing
      good. On the other hand, he was not prepared to live the
      life of almost puritanical strictness which was then
      considered essential for a clergyman, and he saw that the
      impediment of speech from which he suffered would greatly
      interfere with the proper performance of his clerical
      duties.

    <p>
      The Bishop of Oxford, Dr. Wilberforce, had expressed the
      opinion that the "resolution to attend theatres or operas
      was an absolute disqualification for Holy Orders," which
      discouraged him very much, until it transpired that this
      statement was only meant to refer to the parochial clergy.
      He discussed the matter with Dr. Pusey, and with Dr.
      Liddon. The latter said that "he thought a deacon might
      lawfully, if he found himself unfit for the work, abstain
      from direct ministerial duty." And so, with many qualms
      about his own unworthiness, he at last decided to prepare
      definitely for ordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On December 22, 1861, he was ordained deacon by the Bishop
      of Oxford. He never proceeded to priest's orders, partly, I
      think, because he felt that if he were to do so it would be
      his duty to undertake regular parochial work, and partly on
      account of his stammering. He used, however, to preach not
      unfrequently, and his sermons were always delightful to
      listen to, his extreme earnestness being evident in every
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew exactly what he wished to say" (I am quoting from
      an article in <i>The Guardian</i>), "and completely forgot
      his audience in his anxiety to explain his point clearly.
      He thought of the subject only, and the words came of
      themselves. Looking straight in front of him he saw, as it
      were, his argument mapped out in the form of a diagram, and
      he set to work to prove it point by point, under its
      separate heads, and then summed up the whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      One sermon which he preached in the University Church, on
      Eternal Punishment, is not likely to be soon forgotten by
      those who heard it. I, unfortunately, was not of that
      number, but I can well imagine how his clear-cut features
      would light up as he dwelt lovingly upon the mercy of that
      Being whose charity far exceeds "the measure of man's
      mind." It is hardly necessary to say that he himself did
      not believe in eternal punishment, or any other scholastic
      doctrine that contravenes the love of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disliked being complimented on his sermons, but he liked
      to be told of any good effects that his words had had upon
      any member of the congregation. "Thank you for telling me
      that fact about my sermon," he wrote to one of his sisters,
      who told him of some such good fruit that one of his
      addresses had borne. "I have once or twice had such
      information volunteered; and it is a <i>great</i>
      comfort&mdash;and a kind of thing that is <i>really</i> good for
      one to know. It is <i>not</i> good to be told (and I never
      wish to be told), 'Your sermon was so <i>beautiful</i>.' We
      shall not be concerned to know, in the Great Day, whether
      we have preached beautiful sermons, but whether they were
      preached with the one object of serving God."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was always ready and willing to preach at the special
      service for College servants, which used to be held at
      Christ Church every Sunday evening; but best of all he
      loved to preach to children. Some of his last sermons were
      delivered at Christ Church, Eastbourne (the church he
      regularly attended during the Long Vacation), to a
      congregation of children. On those occasions he told them
      an allegory&mdash;<i>Victor and Arnion,</i> which he intended to
      publish in course of time&mdash;putting all his heart into the
      work, and speaking with such deep feeling that at times he
      was almost unable to control his emotion as he told them of
      the love and compassion of the Good Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dwelt at some length on this side of his life, for
      it is, I am sure, almost ignored in the popular estimate of
      him. He was essentially a religious man in the best sense
      of the term, and without any of that morbid sentimentality
      which is too often associated with the word; and while his
      religion consecrated his talents, and raised him to a
      height which without it he could never have reached, the
      example of such a man as he was, so brilliant, so witty, so
      successful, and yet so full of faith, consecrates the very
      conception of religion, and makes it yet more beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On April 13, 1859, he paid another visit to Tennyson, this
      time at Farringford.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      After dinner we retired for about an hour to the
      smoking-room, where I saw the proof-sheets of the "King's
      Idylls," but he would not let me read them. He walked
      through the garden with me when I left, and made me remark
      an effect produced on the thin white clouds by the moon
      shining through, which I had not noticed&mdash;a ring of golden
      light at some distance off the moon, with an interval of
      white between&mdash;this, he says, he has alluded to in one of
      his early poems ("Margaret," vol. i.), "the tender amber."
      I asked his opinion of Sydney Dobell&mdash;he agrees with me in
      liking "Grass from the Battlefield," and thinks him a
      writer of genius and imagination, but extravagant.

      On another occasion he showed the poet a photograph which
      he had taken of Miss Alice Liddell as a beggar-child, and
      which Tennyson said was the most beautiful photograph he
      had ever seen.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Tennyson told us he had often dreamed long passages of
      poetry, and believed them to be good at the time, though he
      could never remember them after waking, except four lines
      which he dreamed at ten years old:&mdash;
      <blockquote>

        May a cock sparrow<br>
        Write to a barrow?<br>

      </blockquote>&mdash;which, as an unpublished fragment of the Poet
      Laureate, may be thought interesting, but not affording
      much promise of his after powers. He also told us he once
      dreamed an enormously long poem about fairies, which began
      with very long lines that gradually got shorter, and ended
      with fifty or sixty lines of two syllables each!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On October 17, 1859, the Prince of Wales came into
      residence at Christ Church. The Dean met him at the
      station, and all the dons assembled in Tom Quadrangle to
      welcome him. Mr. Dodgson, as usual, had an eye to a
      photograph, in which hope, however, he was doomed to
      disappointment. His Royal Highness was tired of having his
      picture taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his early college life he used often to spend a few
      days at Hastings, with his mother's sisters, the Misses
      Lutwidge. In a letter written from their house to his
      sister Mary, and dated April 11, 1860, he gives an account
      of a lecture he had just heard:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am just returned from a series of dissolving views on the
      Arctic regions, and, while the information there received
      is still fresh in my mind, I will try to give you some of
      it. In the first place, you may not know that one of the
      objects of the Arctic expeditions was to discover "the
      intensity of the magnetic needle." He [the lecturer] did
      not tell us, however, whether they had succeeded in
      discovering it, or whether that rather obscure question is
      still doubtful. One of the explorers, Baffin,
      "<i>though</i> he did not suffer all the hardships the
      others did, <i>yet</i> he came to an untimely end (of
      course one would think in the Arctic regions), <i>for
      instance</i> (what follows being, I suppose, one of the
      untimely ends he came to), being engaged in a war of the
      Portuguese against the Prussians, while measuring the
      ground in front of a fortification, a cannon-ball came
      against him, with the force with which cannon-balls in that
      day <i>did</i> come, and killed him dead on the spot." How
      many instances of this kind would you demand to prove that
      he did come to an untimely end? One of the ships was laid
      up three years in the ice, during which time, he told us,
      "Summer came and went frequently." This, I think, was the
      most remarkable phenomenon he mentioned in the whole
      lecture, and gave <i>me</i> quite a new idea of those
      regions.

      about a yard the highest, and the light was like a
      glow-worm, only that it came by flashes and did not shine
      continuously; the cockroach gradually crawled up to it, and
      allowed itself to be taken and killed.

      A few months afterwards, when in town and visiting Mr.
      Munroe's studio, he found there two of the children of Mr.
      George Macdonald, whose acquaintance he had already made:
      "They were a girl and boy, about seven and six years old&mdash;I
      claimed their acquaintance, and began at once proving to
      the boy, Greville, that he had better take the opportunity
      of having his head changed for a marble one. The effect was
      that in about two minutes they had entirely forgotten that
      I was a total stranger, and were earnestly arguing the
      question as if we were old acquaintances." Mr. Dodgson
      urged that a marble head would not have to be brushed and
      combed. At this the boy turned to his sister with an air of
      great relief, saying, "Do you hear <i>that</i>, Mary? It
      needn't be combed!" And the narrator adds, "I have no doubt
      combing, with his great head of long hair, like Hallam
      Tennyson's, was <i>the</i> misery of his life. His final
      argument was that a marble head couldn't speak, and as I
      couldn't convince either that he would be all the better
      for that, I gave in."
    </p>
    <p>
      In November he gave a lecture at a meeting of the Ashmolean
      Society on "Where does the Day begin?" The problem, which
      was one he was very fond of propounding, may be thus
      stated: If a man could travel round the world so fast that
      the sun would be always directly above his head, and if he
      were to start travelling at midday on Tuesday, then in
      twenty-four hours he would return to his original point of
      departure, and would find that the day was now called
      Wednesday&mdash;at what point of his journey would the day change
      its name? The difficulty of answering this apparently
      simple question has cast a gloom over many a pleasant
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      On December 12th he wrote in his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Visit of the Queen to Oxford, to the great surprise of
      everybody, as it had been kept a secret up to the time. She
      arrived in Christ Church about twelve, and came into Hall
      with the Dean, where the Collections were still going on,
      about a dozen men being in Hall. The party consisted of the
      Queen, Prince Albert, Princess Alice and her intended
      husband, the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Prince of
      Wales, Prince Alfred, and suite. They remained a minute or
      two looking at the pictures, and the Sub-Dean was
      presented: they then visited the Cathedral and Library.
      Evening entertainment at the Deanery, <i>tableaux
      vivants</i> . I went a little after half-past eight, and
      found a great party assembled&mdash;the Prince had not yet come.
      He arrived before nine, and I found an opportunity of
      reminding General Bruce of his promise to introduce me to
      the Prince, which he did at the next break in the
      conversation H.R.H. was holding with Mrs. Fellowes. He
      shook hands very graciously, and I began with a sort of
      apology for having been so importunate about the
      photograph. He said something of the weather being against
      it, and I asked if the Americans had victimised him much as
      a sitter; he said they had, but he did not think they had
      succeeded well, and I told him of the new American process
      of taking twelve thousand photographs in an hour. Edith
      Liddell coming by at the moment, I remarked on the
      beautiful <i>tableau</i> which the children might make: he
      assented, and also said, in answer to my question, that he
      had seen and admired my photographs of them. I then said
      that I hoped, as I had missed the photograph, he would at
      least give me his autograph in my album, which he promised
      to do. Thinking I had better bring the talk to an end, I
      concluded by saying that, if he would like copies of any of
      my photographs, I should feel honoured by his accepting
      them; he thanked me for this, and I then drew back, as he
      did not seem inclined to pursue the conversation.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards the Prince gave him his autograph,
      and also chose a dozen or so of his photograph (sic).

    <p>
      It is my aim in this Memoir to let Mr. Dodgson tell his own
      story as much as possible. In order to effect this object I
      have drawn largely upon his Diary and correspondence. Very
      few men have left behind them such copious information
      about their lives as he has; unfortunately it is not
      equally copious throughout, and this fact must be my
      apology for the somewhat haphazard and disconnected way in
      which parts of this book are written. That it is the best
      which, under the circumstances, I have been able to do
      needs, I hope, no saying, but the circumstances have at
      times been too strong for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though in later years Mr. Dodgson almost gave up the habit
      of dining out, at this time of his life he used to do it
      pretty frequently, and several of the notes in his Diary
      refer to after-dinner and Common Room stories. The two
      following extracts will show the sort of facts he
      recorded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>January 2, 1861.</i>&mdash;Mr. Grey (Canon) came to dine and
      stay the night. He told me a curious old custom of millers,
      that they place the sails of the mill as a Saint Andrew's
      Cross when work is entirely suspended, thus x, but in an
      upright cross, thus +, if they are just going to resume
      work. He also mentioned that he was at school with Dr.
      Tennyson (father of the poet), and was a great favourite of
      his. He remembers that Tennyson used to do his
      school-translations in rhyme.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;Met in Common Room Rev. C.F. Knight, and
      the Hon'ble. F.J. Parker, both of Boston, U.S. The former
      gave an amusing account of having seen Oliver Wendell
      Holmes in a fishmonger's, lecturing <i>extempore</i> on the
      head of a freshly killed turtle, whose eyes and jaws still
      showed muscular action: the lecture of course being all
      "cram," but accepted as sober earnest by the mob outside.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Old Oxford men will remember the controversies that raged
      from about 1860 onwards over the opinions of the late Dr.
      Jowett. In my time the name "Jowett" only represented the
      brilliant translator of Plato, and the deservedly loved
      master of Balliol, whose sermons in the little College
      Chapel were often attended by other than Balliol men, and
      whose reputation for learning was expressed in the
      well-known verse of "The Masque of Balliol":&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4">First come I, my name is
    Jowett.</span><br>
    <span class="c4">There's no knowledge but I know
    it;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">I am Master of this College;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">What I don't know isn't
    knowledge.</span><br>
    <p>
      But in 1861 he was anything but universally popular, and I
      am afraid that Mr. Dodgson, nothing if not a staunch
      Conservative, sided with the majority against him. Thus he
      wrote in his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>November 20th.</i>&mdash;Promulgation, in Congregation, of the
      new statute to endow Jowett. The speaking took up the whole
      afternoon, and the two points at issue, the endowing a
      <i>Regius</i> Professorship, and the countenancing Jowett's
      theological opinions, got so inextricably mixed up that I
      rose to beg that they might be kept separate. Once on my
      feet, I said more than I at first meant, and defied them
      ever to tire out the opposition by perpetually bringing the
      question on (<i>Mem</i>.: if I ever speak again I will try
      to say no more than I had resolved before rising). This was
      my first speech in Congregation.
    </blockquote>

      At the beginning of 1862 an "Index to In Memoriam,"
      compiled by Mr. Dodgson and his sisters, was published by
      Moxon. Tennyson had given his consent, and the little book
      proved to be very useful to his admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 27th Morning Prayer was for the first time read
      in English at the Christ Church College Service. On the
      same day Mr. Dodgson moved over into new rooms, as the part
      of the College where he had formerly lived (Chaplain's
      Quadrangle) was to be pulled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Easter Vacation he paid another visit to the
      Tennysons, which he describes as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      After luncheon I went to the Tennysons, and got Hallam and
      Lionel to sign their names in my album. Also I made a
      bargain with Lionel, that he was to give me some MS. of his
      verses, and I was to send him some of mine. It was a very
      difficult bargain to make; I almost despaired of it at
      first, he put in so many conditions&mdash;first, I was to play a
      game of chess with him; this, with much difficulty, was
      reduced to twelve moves on each side; but this made little
      difference, as I check-mated him at the sixth move. Second,
      he was to be allowed to give me one blow on the head with a
      mallet (this he at last consented to give up). I forget if
      there were others, but it ended in my getting the verses,
      for which I have written out "The Lonely Moor" for him.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodgson took a great interest in occult phenomena, and
      was for some time an enthusiastic member of the "Psychical
      Society." It was his interest in ghosts that led to his
      meeting with the artist Mr. Heaphy, who had painted a
      picture of a ghost which he himself had seen. I quote the
      following from a letter to his sister Mary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      During my last visit to town, I paid a very interesting
      visit to a new artist, Mr. Heaphy. Do you remember that
      curious story of a ghost lady (in <i>Household Words</i> or
      <i>All the Year Round</i>), who sat to an artist for her
      picture; it was called "Mr. H.'s Story," and he was the
      writer.... He received me most kindly, and we had a very
      interesting talk about the ghost, which certainly is one of
      the most curious and inexplicable stories I ever heard. He
      showed me her picture (life size), and she must have been
      very lovely, if it is like her (or like it, which ever is
      the correct pronoun).... Mr. Heaphy showed me a most
      interesting collection of drawings he has made abroad; he
      has been about, hunting up the earliest and most authentic
      pictures of our Saviour, some merely outlines, some
      coloured pictures. They agree wonderfully in the character
      of the face, and one, he says, there is no doubt was done
      before the year 150.... I feel sure from his tone that he
      is doing this in a religious spirit, and not merely as an
      artist.
    </blockquote>

      an expedition <i>up</i> the river to Godstow with the three
      Liddells; we had tea on the bank there, and did not reach
      Christ Church till half-past eight."

      "Alice" herself (Mrs. Reginald Hargreaves) has given an
      account of the scene, from which what follows is quoted:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Most of Mr. Dodgson's stories were told to us on river
      expeditions to Nuneham or Godstow, near Oxford. My eldest
      sister, now Mrs. Skene, was "Prima," I was "Secunda," and
      "Tertia" was my sister Edith. I believe the beginning of
      "Alice" was told one summer afternoon when the sun was so
      burning that we had landed in the meadows down the river,
      deserting the boat to take refuge in the only bit of shade
      to be found, which was under a new-made hayrick. Here from
      all three came the old petition of "Tell us a story," and
      so began the ever-delightful tale. Sometimes to tease
      us&mdash;and perhaps being really tired&mdash;Mr. Dodgson would stop
      suddenly and say, "And that's all till next time." "Ah, but
      it is next time," would be the exclamation from all three;
      and after some persuasion the story would start afresh.
      Another day, perhaps, the story would begin in the boat,
      and Mr. Dodgson, in the middle of telling a thrilling
      adventure, would pretend to go fast asleep, to our great
      dismay.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      "Alice's Adventures Underground" was the original name of
      the story; later on it became "Alice's Hour in Elfland." It
      was not until June 18, 1864, that he finally decided upon
      "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." The illustrating of the
      manuscript book gave him some trouble. He had to borrow a
      "Natural History" from the Deanery to learn the correct
      shapes of some of the strange animals with which Alice
      conversed; the Mock Turtle he must have evolved out of his
      inner consciousness, for it is, I think, a species unknown
      to naturalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lucky enough during the course of the year to see a
      ceremony which is denied to most Oxford men. When degrees
      are given, any tradesman who has been unable to get his due
      from an undergraduate about to be made a Bachelor of Arts
      is allowed, by custom, to pluck the Proctor's gown as he
      passes, and then to make his complaint. This law is more
      honoured in the breach than in the observance; but, on the
      occasion of this visit of Mr. Dodgson's to Convocation, the
      Proctor's gown was actually plucked&mdash;on account of an
      unfortunate man who had gone through the Bankruptcy Court.

      When he promised to write out "Alice" for Miss Liddell he
      had no idea of publication; but his friend, Mr. George
      Macdonald, to whom he had shown the story, persuaded him to
      submit it to a publisher. Messrs. Macmillan agreed to
      produce it, and as Mr. Dodgson had not sufficient faith in
      his own artistic powers to venture to allow his
      illustrations to appear, it was necessary to find some
      artist who would undertake the work. By the advice of Tom
      Taylor he approached Mr. Tenniel, who was fortunately well
      disposed, and on April 5, 1864, the final arrangements were
      made.

      The following interesting account of a meeting with Mr.
      Dodgson is from the pen of Mrs. Bennie, wife of the Rector
      of Glenfield, near Leicester:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Some little time after the publication of "Alice's
      Adventures" we went for our summer holiday to Whitby. We
      were visiting friends, and my brother and sister went to
      the hotel. They soon after asked us to dine with them there
      at the <i>table d'h&#244;te.</i> I had on one side of me a
      gentleman whom I did not know, but as I had spent a good
      deal of time travelling in foreign countries, I always, at
      once, speak to any one I am placed next. I found on this
      occasion I had a very agreeable neighbour, and we seemed to
      be much interested in the same books, and politics also
      were touched on. After dinner my sister and brother rather
      took me to task for talking so much to a complete stranger.
      I said. "But it was quite a treat to talk to him and to
      hear him talk. Of one thing I am quite sure, he is a
      genius." My brother and sister, who had not heard him
      speak, again laughed at me, and said, "You are far too
      easily pleased." I, however, maintained my point, and said
      what great delight his conversation had given me, and how
      remarkably clever it had been. Next morning nurse took out
      our two little twin daughters in front of the sea. I went
      out a short time afterwards, looked for them, and found
      them seated with my friend of the <i>table d'h&#244;te</i>
      between them, and they were listening to him, open-mouthed,
      and in the greatest state of enjoyment, with his knee
      covered with minute toys. I, seeing their great delight,
      motioned to him to go on; this he did for some time. A most
      charming story he told them about sea-urchins and
      Ammonites. When it was over, I said, "You must be the
      author of 'Alice's Adventures.'" He laughed, but looked
      astonished, and said, "My dear Madam, my name is Dodgson,
      and 'Alice's Adventures' was written by Lewis Carroll." I
      replied, "Then you must have borrowed the name, for only he
      could have told a story as you have just done." After a
      little sparring he admitted the fact, and I went home and
      proudly told my sister and brother how my genius had turned
      out a greater one than I expected. They assured me I must
      be mistaken, and that, as I had suggested it to him, he had
      taken advantage of the idea, and said he was what I wanted
      him to be. A few days after some friends came to Whitby who
      knew his aunts, and confirmed the truth of his statement,
      and thus I made the acquaintance of one whose friendship
      has been the source of great pleasure for nearly thirty
      years. He has most generously sent us all his books, with
      kind inscriptions, to "Minnie and Doe," whom he
      photographed, but would not take Canon Bennie or me; he
      said he never took portraits of people of more than
      seventeen years of age until they were seventy. He visited
      us, and we often met him at Eastbourne, and his death was
      indeed a great loss after so many happy years of friendship
      with one we so greatly admired and loved.

      He spent a part of the Long Vacation at Freshwater, taking
      great interest in the children who, for him, were the chief
      attraction of the seaside.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Every morning four little children dressed in yellow go by
      from the front down to the beach: they go by in a state of
      great excitement, brandishing wooden spades, and making
      strange noises; from that moment they disappear
      entirely&mdash;they are never to be seen <i>on</i> the beach. The
      only theory I can form is, that they all tumble into a hole
      somewhere, and continue excavating therein during the day:
      however that may be, I have once or twice come across them
      returning at night, in exactly the same state of
      excitement, and seemingly in quite as great a hurry to get
      home as they were before to get out. The evening noises
      they make sound to me very much like the morning noises,
      but I suppose they are different to them, and contain an
      account of the day's achievements.

      His enthusiasm for photography, and his keen appreciation
      of the beautiful, made him prefer the society of artists to
      that of any other class of people. He knew the Rossettis
      intimately, and his Diary shows him to have been acquainted
      with Millais, Holman Hunt, Sant, Westmacott, Val Prinsep,
      Watts, and a host of others. Arthur Hughes painted a
      charming picture to his order ("The Lady with the Lilacs")
      which used to hang in his rooms at Christ Church. The
      Andersons were great friends of his, Mrs. Anderson being
      one of his favourite child-painters. Those who have visited
      him at Oxford will remember a beautiful girl's head,
      painted by her from a rough sketch she had once made in a
      railway carriage of a child who happened to be sitting
      opposite her.

      His own drawings were in no way remarkable. Ruskin, whose
      advice he took on his artistic capabilities, told him that
      he had not enough talent to make it worth his while to
      devote much time to sketching, but every one who saw his
      photographs admired them. Considering the difficulties of
      the "wet process," and the fact that he had a conscientious
      horror of "touching up" his negatives, the pictures he
      produced are quite wonderful. Some of them were shown to
      the Queen, who said that she admired them very much, and
      that they were "such as the Prince would have appreciated
      very highly, and taken much pleasure in."

      The first edition, which consisted of two thousand copies,
      was condemned by both author and illustrator, for the
      pictures did not come out well. All purchasers were
      accordingly asked to return their copies, and to send their
      names and addresses; a new edition was prepared, and
      distributed to those who had sent back their old copies,
      which the author gave away to various homes and hospitals.
      The substituted edition was a complete success, "a perfect
      piece of artistic printing," as Mr. Dodgson called it. He
      hardly dared to hope that more than two thousand copies
      would be sold, and anticipated a considerable loss over the
      book. His surprise was great when edition after edition was
      demanded, and when he found that "Alice," far from being a
      monetary failure, was bringing him in a very considerable
      income every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rough comparison between "Alice's Adventures Underground"
      and the book in its completed form, shows how slight were
      the alterations that Lewis Carroll thought it necessary to
      make.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Wonderland" is somewhat longer, but the general plan
      of the book, and the simplicity of diction, which is one of
      its principal charms, are unchanged. His memory was so good
      that I believe the story as he wrote it down was almost
      word for word the same that he had told in the boat. The
      whole idea came like an inspiration into his mind, and that
      sort of inspiration does not often come more than once in a
      lifetime. Nothing which he wrote afterwards had anything
      like the same amount of freshness, of wit, of real genius.
      The "Looking-Glass" most closely approached it in these
      qualities, but then it was only the following out of the
      same idea. The most ingenuous comparison of the two books I
      have seen was the answer of a little girl whom Lewis
      Carroll had asked if she had read them: "Oh yes, I've read
      both of them, and I think," (this more slowly and
      thoughtfully) "I think 'Through the Looking-Glass' is more
      stupid than 'Alice's Adventures.' Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The critics were loud in their praises of "Alice"; there
      was hardly a dissentient voice among them, and the
      reception which the public gave the book justified their
      opinion. So recently as July, 1898, the <i>Pall Mall
      Gazette</i> conducted an inquiry into the popularity of
      children's books. "The verdict is so natural that it will
      surprise no normal person. The winner is 'Alice in
      Wonderland'; 'Through the Looking-Glass' is in the twenty,
      but much lower down."

      "Alice" has been translated into French, German, Italian,
      and Dutch, while one poem, "Father William," has even been
      turned into Arabic. Several plays have been based upon it;
      lectures have been given, illustrated by magic-lantern
      slides of Tenniel's pictures, which have also adorned
      wall-papers and biscuit-boxes. Mr. Dodgson himself designed
      a very ingenious "Wonderland" stamp-case; there has been an
      "Alice" birthday-book; at schools, children have been
      taught to read out of "Alice," while the German edition,
      shortened and simplified for the purpose, has also been
      used as a lesson-book. With the exception of Shakespeare's
      plays, very few, if any, books are so frequently quoted in
      the daily Press as the two "Alices."

      In 1866 Mr. Dodgson was introduced to Miss Charlotte M.
      Yonge, whose novels had long delighted him. "It was a
      pleasure I had long hoped for," he says, "and I was very
      much pleased with her cheerful and easy manners&mdash;the sort of
      person one knows in a few minutes as well as many in many
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1867 he contributed a story to <i>Aunt Judy's
      Magazine</i> called "Bruno's Revenge," the charming little
      idyll out of which "Sylvie and Bruno" grew. The creation of
      Bruno was the only act of homage Lewis Carroll ever paid to
      boy-nature, for which, as a rule, he professed an aversion
      almost amounting to terror. Nevertheless, on the few
      occasions on which I have seen him in the company of boys,
      he seemed to be thoroughly at his ease, telling them
      stories and showing them puzzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I give an extract from Mrs. Gatty's letter, acknowledging
      the receipt of "Bruno's Revenge" for her magazine:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I need hardly tell you that the story is <i>delicious</i>.
      It is beautiful and fantastic and childlike, and I cannot
      sufficiently thank you. I am so <i>proud</i> for <i>Aunt
      Judy</i> that you have honoured <i>her</i> by sending it
      here, rather than to the <i>Cornhill</i>, or one of the
      grander Magazines.<br>
      <br>
      To-morrow I shall send the Manuscript to London probably;
      to-day I keep it to enjoy a little further, and that the
      young ladies may do so too. One word more. Make this one of
      a series. You may have great mathematical abilities, but so
      have hundreds of others. This talent is peculiarly your
      own, and as an Englishman you are almost unique in
      possessing it. If you covet fame, therefore, it will be (I
      think) gained by this. Some of the touches are so
      exquisite, one would have thought nothing short of
      intercourse with fairies could have put them into your
      head.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Somewhere about this time he was invited to witness a
      rehearsal of a children's play at a London theatre. As he
      sat in the wings, chatting to the manager, a little
      four-year-old girl, one of the performers, climbed up on
      his knee, and began talking to him. She was very anxious to
      be allowed to play the principal part (Mrs. Mite), which
      had been assigned to some other child. "I wish I might act
      Mrs. Mite," she said; "I know all her part, and I'd get an
      <i>encore</i> for every word."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the year he published his book on "Determinants." To
      those accustomed to regard mathematics as the driest of dry
      subjects, and mathematicians as necessarily devoid of
      humour, it seems scarcely credible that "An Elementary
      Treatise on Determinants," and "Alice in Wonderland" were
      written by the same author, and it came quite as a
      revelation to the undergraduate who heard for the first
      time that Mr. Dodgson of Christ Church and Lewis Carroll
      were identical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book in question, admirable as it is in many ways, has
      not commanded a large sale. The nature of the subject would
      be against it, as most students whose aim is to get as good
      a place as possible in the class lists cannot afford the
      luxury of a separate work, and have to be content with the
      few chapters devoted to "Determinants" in works on Higher
      Algebra or the Theory of Equations, supplemented by
      references to Mr. Dodgson's work which can be found in the
      College libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general acceptance of the book would be rather
      restricted by the employment of new words and symbols,
      which, as the author himself felt, "are always a most
      unwelcome addition to a science already burdened with an
      enormous vocabulary." But the work itself is largely
      original, and its arrangement and style are, perhaps, as
      attractive as the nature of the subject will allow. Such a
      book as this has little interest for the general reader,
      yet, amongst the leisured few who are able to read
      mathematics for their own sake, the treatise has found warm
      admirers.

      In the Summer Vacation of 1867 he went for a tour on the
      Continent, accompanied by Dr. Liddon, whom I have already
      mentioned as having been one of his most intimate friends
      at this time. During the whole of this tour Mr. Dodgson
      kept a diary, more with the idea that it would help him
      afterwards to remember what he had seen than with any
      notion of publication. However, in later years it did occur
      to him that others might be interested in his impressions
      and experiences, though he never actually took any steps
      towards putting them before the public. Perhaps he was
      wise, for a traveller's diary always contains much
      information that can be obtained just as well from any
      guide-book. In the extracts which I reproduce here, I hope
      that I have not retained anything which comes under that
      category.

    <blockquote>
      <i>July 12th</i>.&mdash;The Sultan and I arrived in London almost
      at the same time, but in different quarters&mdash;<i>my</i> point
      of entry being Paddington, and <i>his</i> Charing Cross. I
      must admit that the crowd was greatest at the latter place.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodgson and Dr. Liddon met at Dover, and passed the
      night at one of the hotels there:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>July 13th</i>.&mdash;We breakfasted, as agreed, at eight, or
      at least we then sat down and nibbled bread and butter till
      such time as the chops should be done, which great event
      took place about half past. We tried pathetic appeals to
      the wandering waiters, who told us, "They are coming, sir,"
      in a soothing tone, and we tried stern remonstrance, and
      they then said, "They are coming, sir," in a more injured
      tone; and after all such appeals they retired into their
      dens, and hid themselves behind side-boards and
      dish-covers, and still the chops came not. We agreed that
      of all virtues a waiter can display, that of a retiring
      disposition is quite the least desirable....<br>
      <br>
      The pen refuses to describe the sufferings of some of the
      passengers during our smooth trip of ninety minutes: my own
      sensations were those of extreme surprise, and a little
      indignation, at there being no other sensations&mdash;it was not
      for <i>that</i> I paid my money....<br>
      <br>
      We landed at Calais in the usual swarm of friendly natives,
      offering services and advice of all kinds; to all such
      remarks I returned one simple answer, <i>Non!</i> It was
      probably not strictly applicable in all cases, but it
      answered the purpose of getting rid of them; one by one
      they left me, echoing the <i>Non</i>! in various tones, but
      all expressive of disgust.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At Cologne began that feast of beautiful things which his
      artistic temperament fitted him so well to enjoy. Though
      the churches he visited and the ceremonies he witnessed
      belonged to a religious system widely different from his
      own, the largeness and generosity of his mind always led
      him to insist upon that substratum of true devotion&mdash;to use
      a favourite word of his&mdash;which underlies all forms of
      Christianity.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We spent an hour in the cathedral, which I will not attempt
      to describe further than by saying it was the most
      beautiful of all churches I have ever seen or can imagine.
      If one could imagine the spirit of devotion embodied in any
      material form, it would be in such a building.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In spite of all the wealth of words that has been expended
      upon German art, he found something new to say on this most
      fertile subject:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The amount of art lavished on the whole region of Potsdam
      is marvellous; some of the tops of the palaces were like
      forests of statues, and they were all over the gardens, set
      on pedestals. In fact, the two principles of Berlin
      architecture appear to me to be these. On the house-tops,
      wherever there is a convenient place, put up the figure of
      a man; he is best placed standing on one leg. Wherever
      there is room on the ground, put either a circular group of
      busts on pedestals, in consultation, all looking inwards&mdash;or
      else the colossal figure of a man killing, about to kill,
      or having killed (the present tense is preferred) a beast;
      the more pricks the beast has, the better&mdash;in fact a dragon
      is the correct thing, but if that is beyond the artist, he
      may content himself with a lion or a pig. The beast&mdash;killing
      principle has been carried out everywhere with a relentless
      monotony, which makes some parts of Berlin look like a
      fossil slaughter-house.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He never missed an opportunity of studying the foreign
      drama, which was most praiseworthy, as he knew very little
      German and not a word of Russ:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      At the hotel [at Danzig] was a green parrot on a stand; we
      addressed it as "Pretty Poll," and it put its head on one
      side and thought about it, but wouldn't commit itself to
      any statement. The waiter came up to inform us of the
      reason of its silence: "Er spricht nicht Englisch; er
      spricht nicht Deutsch." It appeared that the unfortunate
      bird could speak nothing but Mexican! Not knowing a word of
      that language, we could only pity it.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 23rd.</i>&mdash;We strolled about and bought a few
      photographs, and at 11.39 left for K&#246;nigsberg. On our
      way to the station we came across the grandest instance of
      the "Majesty of Justice" that I have ever witnessed. A
      little boy was being taken to the magistrate, or to prison
      (probably for picking a pocket). The achievement of this
      feat had been entrusted to two soldiers in full uniform,
      who were solemnly marching, one in front of the poor little
      urchin and one behind, with bayonets fixed, of course, to
      be ready to charge in case he should attempt an escape.<br>
      <br>
      <i>July 25th.</i>&mdash;In the evening I visited the theatre at
      K&#246;nigsberg, which was fairly good in every way, and
      very good in the singing and some of the acting. The play
      was "Anno 66," but I could only catch a few words here and
      there, so have very little idea of the plot. One of the
      characters was a correspondent of an English newspaper.
      This singular being came on in the midst of a soldiers'
      bivouac before Sadowa, dressed very nearly in white&mdash;a very
      long frock-coat, and a tall hat on the back of his head,
      both nearly white. He said "Morning" as a general remark,
      when he first came on, but afterwards talked what I suppose
      was broken German. He appeared to be regarded as a butt by
      the soldiers, and ended his career by falling into a drum.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From K&#246;nigsberg the travellers went on to St.
      Petersburg, where they stayed several days, exploring the
      wonderful city and its environs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      There is a fine equestrian statue of Peter the Great near
      the Admiralty. The lower part is not a pedestal, but left
      shapeless and rough like a real rock. The horse is rearing,
      and has a serpent coiled about its hind feet, on which, I
      think, it is treading. If this had been put up in Berlin,
      Peter would no doubt have been actively engaged in killing
      the monster, but here he takes no notice of it; in fact,
      the killing theory is not recognised. We found two colossal
      figures of lions, which are so painfully mild that each of
      them is rolling a great ball about like a kitten.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Aug. 1st</i>.&mdash;About half-past ten Mr. Merrilies called
      for us, and with really remarkable kindness gave up his day
      to taking us down to Peterhof, a distance of about twenty
      miles, and showing us over the place. We went by steamer
      down the tideless, saltless Gulf of Finland; the first
      peculiarity extends through the Baltic, and the second
      through a great part of it. The piece we crossed, some
      fifteen miles from shore to shore, is very shallow, in many
      parts only six or eight feet deep, and every winter it is
      entirely frozen over with ice two feet thick, and when this
      is covered with snow it forms a secure plain, which is
      regularly used for travelling on, though the immense
      distance, without means of food or shelter, is dangerous
      for poorly clad foot passengers. Mr. Merrilies told us of a
      friend of his who, in crossing last winter, passed the
      bodies of eight people who had been frozen. We had a good
      view, on our way, of the coast of Finland, and of
      Kronstadt. When we landed at Peterhof, we found Mr. Muir's
      carriage waiting for us, and with its assistance, getting
      out every now and then to walk through portions where it
      could not go, we went over the grounds of two imperial
      palaces, including many little summer-houses, each of which
      would make a very good residence in itself, as, though
      small, they were fitted up and adorned in every way that
      taste could suggest or wealth achieve. For varied beauty
      and perfect combination of nature and art, I think the
      gardens eclipse those of Sans Souci. At every corner, or
      end of an avenue or path, where a piece of statuary could
      be introduced with effect, there one was sure to find one,
      in bronze or in white marble; many of the latter had a sort
      of circular niche built behind, with a blue background to
      throw the figure into relief. Here we found a series of
      shelving ledges made of stone, with a sheet of water
      gliding down over them; here a long path, stretching down
      slopes and flights of steps, and arched over all the way
      with trellises and creepers; here a huge boulder, hewn,
      just as it lay, into the shape of a gigantic head and face,
      with mild, sphinx-like eyes, as if some buried Titan were
      struggling to free himself; here a fountain, so artfully
      formed of pipes set in circles, each set shooting the water
      higher than those outside, as to form a solid pyramid of
      glittering spray; here a lawn, seen through a break in the
      woods below us, with threads of scarlet geraniums running
      over it, and looking in the distance like a huge branch of
      coral; and here and there long avenues of trees, lying in
      all directions, sometimes three or four together side by
      side, and sometimes radiating like a star, and stretching
      away into the distance till the eye was almost weary of
      following them. All this will rather serve to remind me,
      than to convey any idea, of what we saw.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      But the beauties of Peterhof were quite eclipsed by the
      Oriental splendours of Moscow, which naturally made a great
      impression upon a mind accustomed to the cold sublimity of
      Gothic architecture at Oxford.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We gave five or six hours to a stroll through this
      wonderful city, a city of white houses and green roofs, of
      conical towers that rise one out of another like a
      foreshortened telescope; of bulging gilded domes, in which
      you see, as in a looking-glass, distorted pictures of the
      city; of churches which look, outside, like bunches of
      variegated cactus (some branches crowned with green prickly
      buds, others with blue, and others with red and white) and
      which, inside, are hung all round with <i>eikons</i> and
      lamps, and lined with illuminated pictures up to the very
      roof; and, finally, of pavement that goes up and down like
      a ploughed field, and <i>drojky</i>&mdash;drivers who insist on
      being paid thirty per cent. extra to-day, "because it is
      the Empress's birthday." ...<br>
      <br>
      <i>Aug. 5th.</i>&mdash;After dinner we went by arrangement to Mr.
      Penny, and accompanied him to see a Russian wedding. It was
      a most interesting ceremony. There was a large choir, from
      the cathedral, who sang a long and beautiful anthem before
      the service began; and the deacon (from the Church of the
      Assumption) delivered several recitative portions of the
      service in the most magnificent bass voice I ever heard,
      rising gradually (I should say by less than half a note at
      a time if that is possible), and increasing in volume of
      sound as he rose in the scale, until his final note rang
      through the building like a chorus of many voices. I could
      not have conceived that one voice could have produced such
      an effect. One part of the ceremony, the crowning the
      married couple, was very nearly grotesque. Two gorgeous
      golden crowns were brought in, which the officiating priest
      first waved before them, and then placed on their heads&mdash;or
      rather the unhappy bridegroom had to wear <i>his</i>, but
      the bride, having prudently arranged her hair in a rather
      complicated manner with a lace veil, could not have hers
      put on, but had it held above her by a friend. The
      bridegroom, in plain evening dress, crowned like a king,
      holding a candle, and with a face of resigned misery, would
      have been pitiable if he had not been so ludicrous. When
      the people had gone, we were invited by the priests to see
      the east end of the church, behind the golden gates, and
      were finally dismissed with a hearty shake of the hand and
      the "kiss of peace," of which even I, though in lay
      costume, came in for a share.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One of the objects of the tour was to see the fair at Nijni
      Novgorod, and here the travellers arrived on August 6th,
      after a miserable railway journey. Owing to the breaking
      down of a bridge, the unfortunate passengers had been
      compelled to walk a mile through drenching rain.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We went to the Smernovaya (or some such name) Hotel, a
      truly villainous place, though no doubt the best in the
      town. The feeding was very good, and everything else very
      bad. It was some consolation to find that as we sat at
      dinner we furnished a subject of the liveliest interest to
      six or seven waiters, all dressed in white tunics, belted
      at the waist, and white trousers, who ranged themselves in
      a row and gazed in a quite absorbed way at the collection
      of strange animals that were feeding before them. Now and
      then a twinge of conscience would seize them that they
      were, after all, not fulfilling the great object of life as
      waiters, and on these occasions they would all hurry to the
      end of the room, and refer to a great drawer which seemed
      to contain nothing but spoons and corks. When we asked for
      anything, they first looked at each other in an alarmed
      way; then, when they had ascertained which understood the
      order best, they all followed his example, which always was
      to refer to the big drawer. We spent most of the afternoon
      wandering through the fair, and buying <i>eikons</i>,
      &amp;c. It was a wonderful place. Besides there being
      distinct quarters for the Persians, the Chinese, and
      others, we were constantly meeting strange beings with
      unwholesome complexions and unheard-of costumes. The
      Persians, with their gentle, intelligent faces, the long
      eyes set wide apart, the black hair, and yellow-brown skin,
      crowned with a black woollen fez something like a
      grenadier, were about the most picturesque we met. But all
      the novelties of the day were thrown into the shade by our
      adventure at sunset, when we came upon the Tartar mosque
      (the only one in Nijni) exactly as one of the officials
      came out on the roof to utter the muezzin cry, or call to
      prayers. Even if it had been in no way singular in itself,
      it would have been deeply interesting from its novelty and
      uniqueness, but the cry itself was quite unlike anything I
      have ever heard before. The beginning of each sentence was
      uttered in a rapid monotone, and towards the end it rose
      gradually till it ended in a prolonged, shrill wail, which
      floated overhead through the still air with an
      indescribably sad and ghostlike effect; heard at night, it
      would have thrilled one like the cry of the Banshee.

      This reminds one of the wonderful description in Mr.
      Kipling's "City of Dreadful Night." It is not generally
      known that Mr. Dodgson was a fervent admirer of Mr.
      Kipling's works; indeed during the last few years of his
      life I think he took more pleasure in his tales than in
      those of any other modern author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Liddon's fame as a preacher had reached the Russian
      clergy, with the result that he and Mr. Dodgson found many
      doors open to them which are usually closed to travellers
      in Russia. After their visit to Nijni Novgorod they
      returned to Moscow, whence, escorted by Bishop Leonide,
      Suffragan Bishop of Moscow, they made an expedition to the
      Troitska Monastery.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>August 12th</i>.&mdash;A most interesting day. We breakfasted
      at half-past five, and soon after seven left by railway, in
      company with Bishop Leonide and Mr. Penny, for Troitska
      Monastery. We found the Bishop, in spite of his limited
      knowledge of English, a very conversational and
      entertaining fellow-traveller. The service at the cathedral
      had already begun when we reached it, and the Bishop took
      us in with him, through a great crowd which thronged the
      building, into a side room which opened into the chancel,
      where we remained during the service, and enjoyed the
      unusual privilege of seeing the clergy communicate&mdash;a
      ceremony for which the doors of the chancel are always
      shut, and the curtains drawn, so that the congregation
      never witness it. It was a most elaborate ceremony, full of
      crossings, and waving of incense before everything that was
      going to be used, but also clearly full of much deep
      devotion.... In the afternoon we went down to the
      Archbishop's palace, and were presented to him by Bishop
      Leonide. The Archbishop could only talk Russian, so that
      the conversation between him and Liddon (a most interesting
      one, which lasted more than an hour) was conducted in a
      very original fashion&mdash;the Archbishop making a remark in
      Russian, which was put into English by the Bishop; Liddon
      then answered the remark in French, and the Bishop repeated
      his answer in Russian to the Archbishop. So that a
      conversation, entirely carried on between two people,
      required the use of three languages!<br>
      <br>
      The Bishop had kindly got one of the theological students,
      who could talk French, to conduct us about, which he did
      most zealously, taking us, among other things, to see the
      subterranean cells of the hermits, in which some of them
      live for many years. We were shown the doors of two of the
      inhabited ones; it was a strange and not quite comfortable
      feeling, in a dark narrow passage where each had to carry a
      candle, to be shown the low narrow door of a little cellar,
      and to know that a human being was living within, with only
      a small lamp to give him light, in solitude and silence day
      and night.

    <p>
      His experiences with an exorbitant <i>drojky</i>&mdash;driver at
      St. Petersburg are worthy of record. They remind one of a
      story which he himself used to tell as having happened to a
      friend of his at Oxford. The latter had driven up in a cab
      to Tom Gate, and offered the cabman the proper fare, which
      was, however, refused with scorn. After a long altercation
      he left the irate cabman to be brought to reason by the
      porter, a one-armed giant of prodigious strength. When he
      was leaving college, he stopped at the gate to ask the
      porter how he had managed to dispose of the cabman. "Well,
      sir," replied that doughty champion, "I could not persuade
      him to go until I floored him."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      After a hearty breakfast I left Liddon to rest and write
      letters, and went off shopping, &amp;c., beginning with a
      call on Mr. Muir at No. 61, Galerne Ulitsa. I took a
      <i>drojky</i> to the house, having first bargained with the
      driver for thirty <i>kopecks</i>; he wanted forty to begin
      with. When we got there we had a little scene, rather a
      novelty in my experience of <i>drojky</i>&mdash;driving. The
      driver began by saying "<i>Sorok</i>" (forty) as I got out;
      this was a warning of the coming storm, but I took no
      notice of it, but quietly handed over the thirty. He
      received them with scorn and indignation, and holding them
      out in his open hand, delivered an eloquent discourse in
      Russian, of which <i>sorok</i> was the leading idea. A
      woman, who stood by with a look of amusement and curiosity,
      perhaps understood him. <i>I</i> didn't, but simply held
      out my hand for the thirty, returned them to the purse and
      counted out twenty-five instead. In doing this I felt
      something like a man pulling the string of a
      shower-bath&mdash;and the effect was like it&mdash;his fury boiled over
      directly, and quite eclipsed all the former row. I told him
      in very bad Russian that I had offered thirty once, but
      wouldn't again; but this, oddly enough, did not pacify him.
      Mr. Muir's servant told him the same thing at length, and
      finally Mr. Muir himself came out and gave him the
      substance of it sharply and shortly&mdash;but he failed to see it
      in a proper light. Some people are very hard to please.

      When staying at a friend's house at Kronstadt he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Liddon had surrendered his overcoat early in the day, and
      when going we found it must be recovered from the
      waiting-maid, who only talked Russian, and as I had left
      the dictionary behind, and the little vocabulary did not
      contain <i>coat</i>, we were in some difficulty. Liddon
      began by exhibiting his coat, with much gesticulation,
      including the taking it half-off. To our delight, she
      appeared to understand at once&mdash;left the room, and returned
      in a minute with&mdash;a large clothes-brush. On this Liddon
      tried a further and more energetic demonstration; he took
      off his coat, and laid it at her feet, pointed downwards
      (to intimate that in the lower regions was the object of
      his desire), smiled with an expression of the joy and
      gratitude with which he would receive it, and put the coat
      on again. Once more a gleam of intelligence lighted up the
      plain but expressive features of the young person; she was
      absent much longer this time, and when she returned, she
      brought, to our dismay, a large cushion and a pillow, and
      began to prepare the sofa for the nap that she now saw
      clearly was the thing the dumb gentleman wanted. A happy
      thought occurred to me, and I hastily drew a sketch
      representing Liddon, with one coat on, receiving a second
      and larger one from the hands of a benignant Russian
      peasant. The language of hieroglyphics succeeded where all
      other means had failed, and we returned to St. Petersburg
      with the humiliating knowledge that our standard of
      civilisation was now reduced to the level of ancient
      Nineveh.

      From Warsaw they went on to Leipzig, and thence to Giessen,

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We moved on to Giessen, and put up at the "Rappe Hotel" for
      the night, and ordered an early breakfast of an obliging
      waiter who talked English. "Coffee!" he exclaimed
      delightedly, catching at the word as if it were a really
      original idea, "Ah, coffee&mdash;very nice&mdash;and eggs? Ham with
      your eggs? Very nice&mdash;" "If we can have it broiled," I said.
      "Boiled?" the waiter repeated, with an incredulous smile.
      "No, not <i>boiled</i>," I explained&mdash;"<i>broiled</i>." The
      waiter put aside this distinction as trivial, "Yes, yes,
      ham," he repeated, reverting to his favourite idea. "Yes,
      ham," I said, "but how cooked?" "Yes, yes, how cooked," the
      waiter replied, with the careless air of one who assents to
      a proposition more from good nature than from a real
      conviction of its truth.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sept. 5th</i>.&mdash;At midday we reached Ems, after a journey
      eventless, but through a very interesting country-valleys
      winding away in all directions among hills clothed with
      trees to the very top, and white villages nestling away
      wherever there was a comfortable corner to hide in. The
      trees were so small, so uniform in colour, and so
      continuous, that they gave to the more distant hills
      something of the effect of banks covered with moss. The
      really unique feature of the scenery was the way in which
      the old castles seemed to grow, rather than to have been
      built, on the tops of the rocky promontories that showed
      their heads here and there among the trees. I have never
      seen architecture that seemed so entirely in harmony with
      the spirit of the place. By some subtle instinct the old
      architects seem to have chosen both form and colour, the
      grouping of the towers with their pointed spires, and the
      two neutral tints, light grey and brown, on the walls and
      roof, so as to produce buildings which look as naturally
      fitted to the spot as the heath or the harebells. And, like
      the flowers and the rocks, they seemed instinct with no
      other meaning than rest and silence.

      And with these beautiful words my extracts from the Diary
      may well conclude. Lewis Carroll's mind was completely at
      one with Nature, and in her pleasant places of calm and
      infinite repose he sought his rest&mdash;and has found it.

    <p>
      The success of "Alice in Wonderland" tempted Mr. Dodgson to
      make another essay in the same field of literature. His
      idea had not yet been plagiarised, as it was afterwards,
      though the book had of course been parodied, a notable
      instance being "Alice in Blunderland," which appeared in
      <i>Punch</i>. It was very different when he came to write
      "Sylvie and Bruno"; the countless imitations of the two
      "Alice" books which had been foisted upon the public forced
      him to strike out in a new line. Long before the
      publication of his second tale, people had heard that Lewis
      Carroll was writing again, and the editor of a well-known
      magazine had offered him two guineas a page, which was a
      high rate of pay in those days, for the story, if he would
      allow it to appear in serial form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central idea was, as every one knows, the adventures of
      a little girl who had somehow or other got through a
      looking-glass. The first difficulty, however, was to get
      her through, and this question exercised his ingenuity for
      some time, before it was satisfactorily solved. The next
      thing was to secure Tenniel's services again. At first it
      seemed that he was to be disappointed in this matter;
      Tenniel was so fully occupied with other work that there
      seemed little hope of his being able to undertake any more.
      He then applied to Sir Noel Paton, with whose
      fairy-pictures he had fallen in love; but the artist was
      ill, and wrote in reply, "Tenniel is <i>the</i> man." In
      the end Tenniel consented to undertake the work, and once
      more author and artist settled down to work together. Mr.
      Dodgson was no easy man to work with; no detail was too
      small for his exact criticism. "Don't give Alice so much
      crinoline," he would write, or "The White Knight must not
      have whiskers; he must not be made to look old"&mdash;such were
      the directions he was constantly giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 21st Archdeacon Dodgson died, after an illness of
      only a few days' duration. Lewis Carroll was not summoned
      until too late, for the illness took a sudden turn for the
      worse, and he was unable to reach his father's bedside
      before the end had come. This was a terrible shock to him;
      his father had been his ideal of what a Christian gentleman
      should be, and it seemed to him at first as if a cloud had
      settled on his life which could never be dispelled. Two
      letters of his, both of them written long after the sad
      event, give one some idea of the grief which his father's
      death, and all that it entailed, caused him. The first was
      written long afterwards, to one who had suffered a similar
      bereavement. In this letter he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We are sufficiently old friends, I feel sure, for me to
      have no fear that I shall seem intrusive in writing about
      your great sorrow. The greatest blow that has ever fallen
      on <i>my</i> life was the death, nearly thirty years ago,
      of my own dear father; so, in offering you my sincere
      sympathy, I write as a fellow-sufferer. And I rejoice to
      know that we are not only fellow-sufferers, but also
      fellow-believers in the blessed hope of the resurrection
      from the dead, which makes such a parting holy and
      beautiful, instead of being merely a blank despair.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The second was written to a young friend, Miss Edith Rix,
      who had sent him an illuminated text:
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Edith,&mdash;I can now tell you (what I wanted to do when
      you sent me that text-card, but felt I could not say it to
      <i>two</i> listeners, as it were) <i>why</i> that special
      card is one I like to have. That text is consecrated for me
      by the memory of one of the greatest sorrows I have
      known&mdash;the death of my dear father. In those solemn days,
      when we used to steal, one by one, into the darkened room,
      to take yet another look at the dear calm face, and to pray
      for strength, the one feature in the room that I remember
      was a framed text, illuminated by one of my sisters, "Then
      are they glad, because they are at rest; and so he bringeth
      them into the haven where they would be!" That text will
      always have, for me, a sadness and a sweetness of its own.
      Thank you again for sending it me. Please don't mention
      this when we meet. I can't <i>talk</i> about it.<br>
      <br>
      Always affectionately yours,<br>
      <br>
      C. L. DODGSON.

      The object of his edition of Euclid Book V., published
      during the course of the year, was to meet the requirements
      of the ordinary Pass Examination, and to present the
      subject in as short and simple a form as possible. Hence
      the Theory of Incommensurable Magnitudes was omitted,
      though, as the author himself said in the Preface, to do so
      rendered the work incomplete, and, from a logical point of
      view, valueless. He hinted pretty plainly his own
      preference for an equivalent amount of Algebra, which would
      be complete in itself. It is easy to understand this
      preference in a mind so strictly logical as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as the object of the book itself is concerned, he
      succeeded admirably; the propositions are clearly and
      beautifully worked out, and the hints on proving
      Propositions in Euclid Book V., are most useful.

      In November he again moved into new rooms at Christ Church;
      the suite which he occupied from this date to the end of
      his life was one of the best in the College. Situated at
      the north-west corner of Tom Quad, on the first floor of
      the staircase from the entrance to which the Junior Common
      Room is now approached, they consist of four sitting-rooms
      and about an equal number of bedrooms, besides rooms for
      lumber, &amp;c. From the upper floor one can easily reach
      the flat college roof. Mr. Dodgson saw at once that here
      was the very place for a photographic studio, and he lost
      no time in obtaining the consent of the authorities to
      erect one. Here he took innumerable photographs of his
      friends and their children, as indeed he had been doing for
      some time under less favourable conditions. One of his
      earliest pictures is an excellent likeness of Professor
      Faraday.
    </p>
    <p>
      His study was characteristic of the man; oil paintings by
      A. Hughes, Mrs. Anderson, and Heaphy proclaimed his
      artistic tastes; nests of pigeon-holes, each neatly
      labelled, showed his love of order; shelves, filled with
      the best books on every subject that interested him, were
      evidence of his wide reading. His library has now been
      broken up and, except for a few books retained by his
      nearest relatives, scattered to the winds; such dispersions
      are inevitable, but they are none the less regrettable. It
      always seems to me that one of the saddest things about the
      death of a literary man is the fact that the breaking-up of
      his collection of books almost invariably follows; the
      building up of a good library, the work of a lifetime, has
      been so much labour lost, so far as future generations are
      concerned. Talent, yes, and genius too, are displayed not
      only in writing books but also in buying them, and it is a
      pity that the ruthless hammer of the auctioneer should
      render so much energy and skill fruitless.

      At the beginning of 1869 his "Phantasmagoria," a collection
      of poems grave and gay, was published by Macmillan. Upon
      the whole he was more successful in humorous poetry, but
      there is an undeniable dignity and pathos in his more
      serious verses. He gave a copy to Mr. Justice Denman, with
      whom he afterwards came to be very well acquainted, and who
      appreciated the gift highly. "I did not lay down the book,"
      he wrote, "until I had read them [the poems] through; and
      enjoyed many a hearty laugh, and something like a cry or
      two. Moreover, I hope to read them through (as the <i>old
      man</i> said) 'again and again.'"

      It had been Lewis Carroll's intention to have
      "Phantasmagoria" illustrated, and he had asked George du
      Maurier to undertake the work; but the plan fell through.
      In his letter to du Maurier, Mr. Dodgson had made some
      inquiries about Miss Florence Montgomery, the authoress of
      "Misunderstood." In reply du Maurier said, "Miss Florence
      Montgomery is a very charming and sympathetic young lady,
      the daughter of the admiral of that ilk. I am, like you, a
      very great admirer of "Misunderstood," and cried pints
      over it. When I was doing the last picture I had to put a
      long white pipe in the little boy's mouth until it was
      finished, so as to get rid of the horrible pathos of the
      situation while I was executing the work. In reading the
      book a second time (knowing the sad end of the dear little
      boy), the funny parts made me cry almost as much as the
      pathetic ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the publication of "Phantasmagoria," Lewis
      Carroll sent the first chapter of his new story to the
      press. "Behind the Looking-Glass and what Alice saw there"
      was his original idea for its title; it was Dr. Liddon who
      suggested the name finally adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this year German and French translations of "Alice
      in Wonderland" were published by Macmillan; the Italian
      edition appeared in 1872. Henri Bu&#233;, who was
      responsible for the French version, had no easy task to
      perform. In many cases the puns proved quite
      untranslatable; while the poems, being parodies on
      well-known English pieces, would have been pointless on the
      other side of the Channel. For instance, the lines
      beginning, "How doth the little crocodile" are a parody on
      "How doth the little busy bee," a song which a French child
      has, of course, never heard of. In this case Bu&#233;
      gave up the idea of translation altogether, and, instead,
      parodied La Fontaine's "Ma&#238;tre Corbeau" as follows:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c6">Ma&#238;tre Corbeau sur un arbre
    perch&#233;</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Faisait son nid entre des
    branches;</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Il avait relev&#233; ses
    manches,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Car il &#233;tait tr&#232;s
    affair&#233;.</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Ma&#238;tre Renard par l&#224;
    passant,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Lui dit: "Descendez donc,
    comp&#232;re;</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Venez embrasser votre
    fr&#232;re!"</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Le Corbeau, le reconnaissant,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Lui r&#233;pondit en son
    ramage!&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c7">"Fromage."</span><br>
    <p>
      The dialogue in which the joke occurs about "tortoise" and
      "taught us" ("Wonderland," p. 142) is thus rendered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "La ma&#238;tresse &#233;tait une vieille tortue; nous
      l'appelions ch&#233;lon&#233;e."<br>
      "Et pourquoi l'appeliez-vous ch&#233;lon&#233;e, si ce
      n'&#233;tait pas son nom?"<br>
      "Parcequ'on ne pouvait s'emp&#234;cher de s'&#233;crier
      en la voyant: Quel long nez!" dit la Fausse-Tortue d'un ton
      f&#226;ch&#233;; "vous &#234;tes vraiment bien
      born&#233;e!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At two points, however, both M. Bu&#233; and Miss Antonie
      Zimmermann, who translated the tale into German, were
      fairly beaten: the reason for the whiting being so called,
      from its doing the boots and shoes, and for no wise fish
      going anywhere without a porpoise, were given up as
      untranslatable.

      At the beginning of 1870 Lord Salisbury came up to Oxford
      to be installed as Chancellor of the University. Dr. Liddon
      introduced Mr. Dodgson to him, and thus began a very
      pleasant acquaintance. Of course he photographed the
      Chancellor and his two sons, for he never missed an
      opportunity of getting distinguished people into his
      studio.

      In December, seven "Puzzles from Wonderland" appeared in
      Mrs. Gatty's paper, <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>. They had
      originally been written for the Cecil children, with whom
      Lewis Carroll was already on the best terms. Meanwhile
      "Through the Looking-Glass" was steadily progressing&mdash;not,
      however, without many little hitches. One question which
      exercised Mr. Dodgson very much was whether the picture of
      the Jabberwock would do as a frontispiece, or whether it
      would be too frightening for little children. On this point
      he sought the advice of about thirty of his married lady
      friends, whose experiences with their own children would
      make them trustworthy advisers; and in the end he chose the
      picture of the White Knight on horseback. In 1871 the book
      appeared, and was an instantaneous success. Eight thousand
      of the first edition had been taken up by the booksellers
      before Mr. Dodgson had even received his own presentation
      copies. The compliments he received upon the
      "Looking-Glass" would have been enough to turn a lesser
      man's head, but he was, I think, proof against either
      praise or blame.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I can say with a clear head and conscience [wrote Henry
      Kingsley] that your new book is the finest thing we have
      had since "Martin Chuzzlewit." ... I can only say, in
      comparing the new "Alice" with the old, "this is a more
      excellent song than the other." It is perfectly splendid,
      but you have, doubtless, heard that from other quarters. I
      lunch with Macmillan habitually, and he was in a terrible
      pickle about not having printed enough copies the other
      day.

    <p>
      Jabberwocky<a name="FNanchor017"></a><a href="#Footnote_017"><sup>[017]</sup></a> was at once recognised
      as the best and most original thing in the book, though one
      fair correspondent of <i>The Queen</i> declared that it was
      a translation from the German! The late Dean of Rochester,
      Dr. Scott, writes about it to Mr. Dodgson as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Are we to suppose, after all, that the Saga of Jabberwocky
      is one of the universal heirlooms which the Aryan race at
      its dispersion carried with it from the great cradle of the
      family? You must really consult Max M&#252;ller about this.
      It begins to be probable that the <i>origo
      originalissima</i> may be discovered in Sanscrit, and that
      we shall by and by have a <i>Iabrivokaveda</i> . The hero
      will turn out to be the Sun-god in one of his
      <i>Avatars</i>; and the Tumtum tree the great Ash
      <i>Ygdrasil</i> of the Scandinavian mythology.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In March, 1872, the late Mr. A.A. Vansittart, of Trinity
      College, Cambridge, translated the poem into Latin
      elegiacs. His rendering was printed, for private
      circulation only, I believe, several years later, but will
      probably be new to most of my readers. A careful comparison
      with the original shows the wonderful fidelity of this
      translation:&mdash;

      The story, as originally written, contained thirteen
      chapters, but the published book consisted of twelve only.
      The omitted chapter introduced a wasp, in the character of
      a judge or barrister, I suppose, since Mr. Tenniel wrote
      that "a <i>wasp</i> in a <i>wig</i> is altogether beyond
      the appliances of art." Apart from difficulties of
      illustration, the "wasp" chapter was not considered to be
      up to the level of the rest of the book, and this was
      probably the principal reason of its being left out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a curious fact," wrote Mr. Tenniel some years later,
      when replying to a request of Lewis Carroll's that he would
      illustrate another of his books, "that with 'Through the
      Looking-Glass' the faculty of making drawings for book
      illustration departed from me, and, notwithstanding all
      sorts of tempting inducements, I have done nothing in that
      direction since."

    <p>
      "Through the Looking Glass" has recently appeared in a
      solemn judgment of the House of Lords. In <i>Eastman
      Photographic Materials Company v. Comptroller General of
      Patents, Designs, and Trademarks</i> (1898), the question
      for decision was, What constitutes an invented word? A
      trademark that consists of or contains an invented word or
      words is capable of registration. "Solio" was the word in
      issue in the case. Lord Macnaghten in his judgment said,
      when alluding to the distinguishing characteristics of an
      invented word:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I do not think that it is necessary that it should be
      wholly meaningless. To give an illustration: your lordships
      may remember that in a book of striking humour and fancy,
      which was in everybody's hands when it was first published,
      there is a collection of strange words where "there are"
      (to use the language of the author) "two meanings packed up
      into one word." No one would say that those were not
      invented words. Still they contain a meaning&mdash;a meaning is
      wrapped up in them if you can only find it out.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Before I leave the subject of the "Looking-Glass," I should
      like to mention one or two circumstances in connection with
      it which illustrate his reverence for sacred things. In his
      original manuscript the bad-tempered flower (pp. 28&mdash;33) was
      the passion-flower; the sacred origin of the name never
      struck him, until it was pointed out to him by a friend,
      when he at once changed it into the tiger-lily. Another
      friend asked him if the final scene was based upon the
      triumphal conclusion of "Pilgrim's Progress." He repudiated
      the idea, saying that he would consider such trespassing on
      holy ground as highly irreverent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed never to be satisfied with the amount of work he
      had on hand, and in 1872 he determined to add to his other
      labours by studying anatomy and physiology. Professor
      Barclay Thompson supplied him with a set of bones, and,
      having purchased the needful books, he set to work in good
      earnest. His mind was first turned to acquiring medical
      knowledge by his happening to be at hand when a man was
      seized with an epileptic fit. He had prevented the poor
      creature from falling, but was utterly at a loss what to do
      next. To be better prepared on any future occasion, he
      bought a little manual called "What to do in Emergencies."
      In later years he was constantly buying medical and
      surgical works, and by the end of his life he had a library
      of which no doctor need have been ashamed. There were only
      two special bequests in his will, one of some small
      keepsakes to his landlady at Eastbourne, Mrs. Dyer, and the
      other of his medical books to my brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a new idea presented itself to his mind he used to
      make a note of it; he even invented a system by which he
      could take notes in the dark, if some happy thought or
      ingenious problem suggested itself to him during a
      sleepless night. Like most men who systematically overtax
      their brains, he was a poor sleeper. He would sometimes go
      through a whole book of Euclid in bed; he was so familiar
      with the bookwork that he could actually see the figures
      before him in the dark, and did not confuse the letters,
      which is perhaps even more remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his ideas were ingenious, though many were entirely
      useless from a practical point of view. For instance, he
      has an entry in his Diary on November 8, 1872: "I wrote to
      Calverley, suggesting an idea (which I think occurred to me
      yesterday) of guessing well-known poems as acrostics, and
      making a collection of them to hoax the public."
      Calverley's reply to this letter was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Sir,&mdash;I have been laid up (or laid down) for the
      last few days by acute lumbago, or I would have written
      before. It is rather absurd that I was on the point of
      propounding to you this identical idea. I realised, and I
      regret to add revealed to two girls, a fortnight ago, the
      truth that all existing poems were in fact acrostics; and I
      offered a small pecuniary reward to whichever would find
      out Gray's "Elegy" within half an hour! But it never
      occurred to me to utilise the discovery, as it did to you.
      I see that it might be utilised, now you mention it&mdash;and I
      shall instruct these two young women not to publish the
      notion among their friends.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is the way Mr. Calverley treated Kirke White's poem
      "To an early Primrose." "The title," writes C.S.C. "might
      either be ignored or omitted. Possibly carpers might say
      that a primrose was not a rose."

      In the course of their correspondence Mr. Calverley wrote a
      Shakespearian sonnet, the initial letters of which form the
      name of William Herbert; and a parody entitled "The New
      Hat." I reproduce them both.

      Mr. Dodgson spent the last night of the old year (1872) at
      Hatfield, where he was the guest of Lord Salisbury. There
      was a large party of children in the house, one of them
      being Princess Alice, to whom he told as much of the story
      of "Sylvie and Bruno" as he had then composed. While the
      tale was in progress Lady Salisbury entered the room,
      bringing in some new toy or game to amuse her little
      guests, who, with the usual thoughtlessness of children,
      all rushed off and left Mr. Dodgson. But the little
      Princess, suddenly appearing to remember that to do so
      might perhaps hurt his feelings, sat down again by his
      side. He read the kind thought which prompted her action,
      and was much pleased by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Dodgson knew several members of the <i>Punch</i>
      staff, he used to send up any little incidents or remarks
      that particularly amused him to that paper. He even went so
      far as to suggest subjects for cartoons, though I do not
      know if his ideas were ever carried out. One of the
      anecdotes he sent to <i>Punch</i> was that of a little boy,
      aged four, who after having listened with much attention to
      the story of Lot's wife, asked ingenuously, "Where does
      salt come from that's <i>not</i> made of ladies?" This
      appeared on January 3, 1874.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is one of several such little anecdotes
      jotted down by Lewis Carroll for future use: Dr. Paget was
      conducting a school examination, and in the course of his
      questions he happened to ask a small child the meaning of
      "Average." He was utterly bewildered by the reply, "The
      thing that hens lay on," until the child explained that he
      had read in a book that hens lay <i>on an average</i> so
      many eggs a year.

      Among the notable people whom he photographed was John
      Ruskin, and, as several friends begged him for copies, he
      wrote to ask Mr. Ruskin's leave. The reply was, "Buy Number
      5 of <i>Fors Clavigera</i> for 1871, which will give you
      your answer." This was not what Mr. Dodgson wanted, so he
      wrote back, "Can't afford ten-pence!" Finally Mr. Ruskin
      gave his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time came the anonymous publication of "Notes by
      an Oxford Chiel," a collection of papers written on various
      occasions, and all of them dealing with Oxford
      controversies. Taking them in order, we have first "The New
      Method of Evaluation as applied to <i>pi</i>," first
      published by Messrs. Parker in 1865, which had for its
      subject the controversy about the Regius Professorship of
      Greek. One extract will be sufficient to show the way in
      which the affair was treated: "Let U = the University, G =
      Greek, and P = Professor. Then G P = Greek Professor; let
      this be reduced to its lowest terms and call the result J
      [i.e., Jowett]."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second paper is called "The Dynamics of a Parti-cle,"
      and is quite the best of the series; it is a geometrical
      treatment of the contest between Mr. Gathorne Hardy and Mr.
      Gladstone for the representation of the University. Here
      are some of the "Definitions" with which the subject was
      introduced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Plain Superficiality</i> is the character of a speech,
      in which any two points being taken, the speaker is found
      to lie wholly with regard to those two points.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Plain Anger</i> is the inclination of two voters to one
      another, who meet together, but whose views are not in the
      same direction.<br>
      <br>
      When two parties, coming together, feel a Right Anger, each
      is <i>said</i> to be <i>complimentary</i> to the other,
      though, strictly speaking, this is very seldom the
      case.<br>
      <br>
      <i>A surd</i> is a radical whose meaning cannot be exactly
      ascertained.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As the "Notes of an Oxford Chiel" has been long out of
      print, I will give a few more extracts from this paper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>On Differentiation.</i><br>
      <br>
      The effect of Differentiation on a Particle is very
      remarkable, the first differential being frequently of
      greater value than the original particle, and the second of
      less enlightenment.<br>
      <br>
      For example, let L = "Leader", S = "Saturday", and then LS =
      "Leader in the Saturday" (a particle of no assignable
      value). Differentiating once, we get L.S.D., a function of
      great value. Similarly it will be found that, by taking the
      second Differential of an enlightened Particle
      (<i>i.e.,</i> raising it to the Degree D.D.), the
      enlightenment becomes rapidly less. The effect is much
      increased by the addition of a C: in this case the
      enlightenment often vanishes altogether, and the Particle
      becomes Conservative.<br>

    <p>
      The third paper was entitled "Facts, Figures, and Fancies."
      The best thing in it was a parody on "The Deserted
      Village," from which an extract will be found in a later
      chapter. There was also a letter to the Senior Censor of
      Christ Church, in burlesque of a similar letter in which
      the Professor of Physics met an offer of the Clarendon
      Trustees by a detailed enumeration of the requirements in
      his own department of Natural Science. Mr. Dodgson's letter
      deals with the imaginary requirements of the Mathematical
      school:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Senior Censor,&mdash;In a desultory conversation on a point
      connected with the dinner at our high table, you
      incidentally remarked to me that lobster-sauce, "though a
      necessary adjunct to turbot, was not entirely
      wholesome!"<br>
      <br>
      It is entirely unwholesome. I never ask for it without
      reluctance: I never take a second spoonful without a
      feeling of apprehension on the subject of a possible
      nightmare. This naturally brings me to the subject of
      Mathematics, and of the accommodation provided by the
      University for carrying on the calculations necessary in
      that important branch of Science.<br>
      <br>
      As Members of Convocation are called upon (whether
      personally, or, as is less exasperating, by letter) to
      consider the offer of the Clarendon Trustees, as well as
      every other subject of human, or inhuman, interest, capable
      of consideration, it has occurred to me to suggest for your
      consideration how desirable roofed buildings are for
      carrying on mathematical calculations: in fact, the
      variable character of the weather in Oxford renders it
      highly inexpedient to attempt much occupation, of a
      sedentary nature, in the open air.<br>
      <br>
      Again, it is often impossible for students to carry on
      accurate mathematical calculations in close contiguity to
      one another, owing to their mutual conversation;
      consequently these processes require different rooms in
      which irrepressible conversationalists, who are found to
      occur in every branch of Society, might be carefully and
      permanently fixed.<br>
      <br>
      It may be sufficient for the present to enumerate the
      following requisites&mdash;others might be added as funds
      permit:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      A. A very large room for calculating Greatest Common
      Measure. To this a small one might be attached for Least
      Common Multiple: this, however, might be dispensed
      with.<br>
      <br>
      B. A piece of open ground for keeping Roots and practising
      their extraction: it would be advisable to keep Square
      Roots by themselves, as their corners are apt to damage
      others.<br>
      <br>
      C. A room for reducing Fractions to their Lowest Terms.
      This should be provided with a cellar for keeping the
      Lowest Terms when found, which might also be available to
      the general body of Undergraduates, for the purpose of
      "keeping Terms."<br>
      <br>
      D. A large room, which might be darkened, and fitted up
      with a magic lantern, for the purpose of exhibiting
      circulating Decimals in the act of circulation. This might
      also contain cupboards, fitted with glass doors, for
      keeping the various Scales of Notation.<br>
      <br>
      E. A narrow strip of ground, railed off and carefully
      levelled, for investigating the properties of Asymptotes,
      and testing practically whether Parallel Lines meet or not:
      for this purpose it should reach, to use the expressive
      language of Euclid, "ever so far."<br>
      <br>
      This last process of "continually producing the lines," may
      require centuries or more; but such a period, though long
      in the life of an individual, is as nothing in the life of
      the University.<br>
      <br>
      As Photography is now very much employed in recording human
      expressions, and might possibly be adapted to Algebraical
      Expressions, a small photographic room would be desirable,
      both for general use and for representing the various
      phenomena of Gravity, Disturbance of Equilibrium,
      Resolution, &amp;c., which affect the features during
      severe mathematical operations.<br>
      <br>
      May I trust that you will give your immediate attention to
      this most important subject?<br>
      <br>
      Believe me,<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely yours,<br>
      <br>
      Mathematicus.

    <p>
      Next came "The New Belfry of Christ Church, Oxford; a
      Monograph by D.C.L." On the title-page was a neatly drawn
      square&mdash;the figure of Euclid I. 46&mdash;below which was written
      "East view of the New Belfry, Christ Church, as seen from
      the meadow." The new belfry is fortunately a thing of the
      past, and its insolent hideousness no longer defaces Christ
      Church, but while it lasted it was no doubt an excellent
      target for Lewis Carroll's sarcasm. His article on it is
      divided into thirteen chapters. Three of them are perhaps
      worth quoting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      &#167;1. <i>On the etymological significance of the new
      Belfry, Ch. Ch</i>.<br>
      <br>
      The word "Belfry" is derived from the French <i>bel</i>,
      "beautiful, becoming, meet," and from the German
      <i>frei</i>, "free unfettered, secure, safe." Thus, the
      word is strictly equivalent to "meat-safe," to which the
      new Belfry bears a resemblance so perfect as almost to
      amount to coincidence.<br>
      <br>
      &#167;4. <i>On the chief architectural merit of the new
      Belfry, Ch. Ch</i>.<br>
      <br>
      Its chief merit is its simplicity&mdash;a simplicity so pure, so
      profound, in a word, so <i>simple</i>, that no other word
      will fitly describe it. The meagre outline, and baldness of
      detail, of the present Chapter, are adopted in humble
      imitation of this great feature.<br>
      <br>
      &#167;5. <i>On the other architectural merits of the new
      Belfry, Ch. Ch</i>.<br>
      <br>
      The Belfry has no other architectural merits.
    </blockquote><br>
    <br>
    <p>
      "The Vision of the Three T's" followed. It also was an
      attack on architectural changes in Christ Church; the
      general style was a parody of the "Compleat Angler." Last
      of all came "The Blank Cheque, a Fable," in reference to
      the building of the New Schools, for the expenses of which
      it was actually proposed (in 1874), to sign a blank cheque
      before any estimate had been made, or any plan laid before
      the University, and even before a committee had been
      elected to appoint an architect for the work.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      At the end of 1874 Mr. Dodgson was again at Hatfield, where
      he told the children the story of Prince Uggug, which was
      afterwards made a part of "Sylvie and Bruno," though at
      that time it seems to have been a separate tale. But
      "Sylvie and Bruno," in this respect entirely unlike "Alice
      in Wonderland," was the result of notes taken during many
      years; for while he was thinking out the book he never
      neglected any amusing scraps of childish conversation or
      funny anecdotes about children which came to his notice. It
      is this fact which gives such verisimilitude to the prattle
      of Bruno; childish talk is a thing which a grown-up person
      cannot possibly <i>invent</i>. He can only listen to the
      actual things the children say, and then combine what he
      has heard into a connected narrative.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      During 1875 Mr. Dodgson wrote an article on "Some Popular
      Fallacies about Vivisection," which was refused by the
      <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, the editor saying that he had
      never heard of most of them; on which Mr. Dodgson
      plaintively notes in his Diary that seven out of the
      thirteen fallacies dealt with in his essay had appeared in
      the columns of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>. Ultimately it
      was accepted by the editor of <i>The Fortnightly
      Review</i>. Mr. Dodgson had a peculiar horror of
      vivisection. I was once walking in Oxford with him when a
      certain well-known professor passed us. "I am afraid that
      man vivisects," he said, in his gravest tone. Every year he
      used to get a friend to recommend him a list of suitable
      charities to which he should subscribe. Once the name of
      some Lost Dogs' Home appeared in this list. Before Mr.
      Dodgson sent his guinea he wrote to the secretary to ask
      whether the manager of the Home was in the habit of sending
      dogs that had to be killed to physiological laboratories
      for vivisection. The answer was in the negative, so the
      institution got the cheque. He did not, however, advocate
      the total abolition of vivisection&mdash;what reasonable man
      could?&mdash;but he would have liked to see it much more
      carefully restricted by law. An earlier letter of his to
      the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> on the same subject is
      sufficiently characteristic to deserve a place here. Be it
      noted that he signed it "Lewis Carroll," in order that
      whatever influence or power his writings had gained him
      might tell in the controversy.

      <h4>
        VIVISECTION AS A SIGN OF THE TIMES.
      </h4><i>To the Editor of the "Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br>
      <br>
      Sir,&mdash;The letter which appeared in last week's
      <i>Spectator</i>, and which must have saddened the heart of
      every one who read it, seems to suggest a question which
      has not yet been asked or answered with sufficient
      clearness, and that is, How far may vivisection be regarded
      as a sign of the times, and a fair specimen of that higher
      civilisation which a purely secular State education is to
      give us? In that much-vaunted panacea for all human ills we
      are promised not only increase of knowledge, but also a
      higher moral character; any momentary doubt on this point
      which we may feel is set at rest at once by quoting the
      great crucial instance of Germany. The syllogism, if it
      deserves the name, is usually stated thus: Germany has a
      higher scientific education than England; Germany has a
      lower average of crime than England; <i>ergo</i>, a
      scientific education tends to improve moral conduct. Some
      old-fashioned logician might perhaps whisper to himself,
      "Praemissis particularibus nihil probatur," but such a
      remark, now that Aldrich is out of date, would only excite
      a pitying smile. May we, then, regard the practice of
      vivisection as a legitimate fruit, or as an abnormal
      development, of this higher moral character? Is the
      anatomist, who can contemplate unmoved the agonies he is
      inflicting for no higher purpose than to gratify a
      scientific curiosity, or to illustrate some
      well-established truth, a being higher or lower, in the
      scale of humanity, than the ignorant boor whose very soul
      would sicken at the horrid sight? For if ever there was an
      argument in favour of purely scientific education more
      cogent than another, it is surely this (a few years back it
      might have been put into the mouth of any advocate of
      science; now it reads like the merest mockery): "What can
      teach the noble quality of mercy, of sensitiveness to all
      forms of suffering, so powerfully as the knowledge of what
      suffering really is? Can the man who has once realised by
      minute study what the nerves are, what the brain is, and
      what waves of agony the one can convey to the other, go
      forth and wantonly inflict pain on any sentient being?" A
      little while ago we should have confidently replied, "He
      cannot do it"; in the light of modern revelations we must
      sorrowfully confess "He can." And let it never be said that
      this is done with serious forethought of the balance of
      pain and gain; that the operator has pleaded with himself,
      "Pain is indeed an evil, but so much suffering may fitly be
      endured to purchase so much knowledge." When I hear of one
      of these ardent searchers after truth giving, not a
      helpless dumb animal, to whom he says in effect,
      "<i>You</i> shall suffer that <i>I</i> may know," but his
      own person to the probe and to the scalpel, I will believe
      in him as recognising a principle of justice, and I will
      honour him as acting up to his principles. "But the thing
      cannot be!" cries some amiable reader, fresh from an
      interview with that most charming of men, a London
      physician. "What! Is it possible that one so gentle in
      manner, so full of noble sentiments, can be hardhearted?
      The very idea is an outrage to common sense!" And thus we
      are duped every day of our lives. Is it possible that that
      bank director, with his broad honest face, can be
      meditating a fraud? That the chairman of that meeting of
      shareholders, whose every tone has the ring of truth in it,
      can hold in his hand a "cooked" schedule of accounts? That
      my wine merchant, so outspoken, so confiding, can be
      supplying me with an adulterated article? That the
      schoolmaster, to whom I have entrusted my little boy, can
      starve or neglect him? How well I remember his words to the
      dear child when last we parted. "You are leaving your
      friends," he said, "but you will have a father in me, my
      dear, and a mother in Mrs. Squeers!" For all such
      rose-coloured dreams of the necessary immunity from human
      vices of educated men the facts in last week's
      <i>Spectator</i> have a terrible significance. "Trust no
      man further than you can see him," they seem to say. "Qui
      vult decipi, decipiatur."<br>
      <br>
      Allow me to quote from a modern writer a few sentences
      bearing on this subject:&mdash;<br>
      <blockquote>
        "We are at present, legislature and nation together,
        eagerly pushing forward schemes which proceed on the
        postulate that conduct is determined, not by feelings,
        but by cognitions. For what else is the assumption
        underlying this anxious urging-on of organisations for
        teaching? What is the root-notion common to Secularists
        and Denominationalists but the notion that spread of
        knowledge is the one thing needful for bettering
        behaviour? Having both swallowed certain statistical
        fallacies, there has grown up in them the belief that
        State education will check ill-doing.... This belief in
        the moralising effects of intellectual culture, flatly
        contradicted by facts, is absurd <i>a priori</i>.... This
        faith in lesson-books and readings is one of the
        superstitions of the age.... Not by precept, though heard
        daily; not by example, unless it is followed; but only by
        action, often caused by the related feeling, can a moral
        habit be formed. And yet this truth, which mental science
        clearly teaches, and which is in harmony with familiar
        sayings, is a truth wholly ignored in current educational
        fanaticisms."
      </blockquote><br>
      There need no praises of mine to commend to the
      consideration of all thoughtful readers these words of
      Herbert Spencer. They are to be found in "The Study of
      Sociology" (pp. 36l&mdash;367).<br>
      <br>
      Let us, however, do justice to science. It is not so wholly
      wanting as Mr. Herbert Spencer would have us believe in
      principles of action&mdash;principles by which we may regulate
      our conduct in life. I myself once heard an accomplished
      man of science declare that his labours had taught him one
      special personal lesson which, above all others, he had
      laid to heart. A minute study of the nervous system, and of
      the various forms of pain produced by wounds had inspired
      in him one profound resolution; and that was&mdash;what think
      you?&mdash;never, under any circumstances, to adventure his own
      person into the field of battle! I have somewhere read in a
      book&mdash;a rather antiquated book, I fear, and one much
      discredited by modern lights&mdash;the words, "the whole creation
      groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." Truly
      we read these words with a new meaning in the present day!
      "Groan and travail" it undoubtedly does still (more than
      ever, so far as the brute creation is concerned); but to
      what end? Some higher and more glorious state? So one might
      have said a few years back. Not so in these days. The
      <i>telos teleion</i> of secular education, when divorced
      from religious or moral training, is&mdash;I say it
      deliberately&mdash;the purest and most unmitigated selfishness.
      The world has seen and tired of the worship of Nature, of
      Reason, of Humanity; for this nineteenth century has been
      reserved the development of the most refined religion of
      all&mdash;the worship of Self. For that, indeed, is the upshot of
      it all. The enslavement of his weaker brethren&mdash;"the labour
      of those who do not enjoy, for the enjoyment of those who
      do not labour"&mdash;the degradation of woman&mdash;the torture of the
      animal world&mdash;these are the steps of the ladder by which man
      is ascending to his higher civilisation. Selfishness is the
      key-note of all purely secular education; and I take
      vivisection to be a glaring, a wholly unmistakable case in
      point. And let it not be thought that this is an evil that
      we can hope to see produce the good for which we are asked
      to tolerate it, and then pass away. It is one that tends
      continually to spread. And if it be tolerated or even
      ignored now, the age of universal education, when the
      sciences, and anatomy among them, shall be the heritage of
      all, will be heralded by a cry of anguish from the brute
      creation that will ring through the length and breadth of
      the land! This, then, is the glorious future to which the
      advocate of secular education may look forward: the dawn
      that gilds the horizon of his hopes! An age when all forms
      of religious thought shall be things of the past; when
      chemistry and biology shall be the ABC of a State education
      enforced on all; when vivisection shall be practised in
      every college and school; and when the man of science,
      looking forth over a world which will then own no other
      sway than his, shall exult in the thought that he has made
      of this fair green earth, if not a heaven for man, at least
      a hell for animals.<br>

      On March 29, 1876, "The Hunting of the Snark" was
      published. Mr. Dodgson gives some interesting particulars
      of its evolution. The first idea for the poem was the line
      "For the Snark <i>was</i> a Boojum, you see," which came
      into his mind, apparently without any cause, while he was
      taking a country walk. The first complete verse which he
      composed was the one which stands last in the poem:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c6">In the midst of the word he was trying
    to say,</span><br>
    <span class="c8">In the midst of his laughter and
    glee,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">He had softly and suddenly vanished
    away&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c8">For the Snark <i>was</i> a Boojum, you

      The illustrations were the work of Mr. Henry Holiday, and
      they are thoroughly in keeping with the spirit of the poem.
      Many people have tried to show that "The Hunting of the
      Snark" was an allegory; some regarding it as being a
      burlesque upon the Tichborne case, and others taking the
      Snark as a personification of popularity. Lewis Carroll
      always protested that the poem had no meaning at all.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      As to the meaning of the Snark [he wrote to a friend in
      America], I'm very much afraid I didn't mean anything but
      nonsense. Still, you know, words mean more than we mean to
      express when we use them; so a whole book ought to mean a
      great deal more than the writer means. So, whatever good
      meanings are in the book, I'm glad to accept as the meaning
      of the book. The best that I've seen is by a lady (she
      published it in a letter to a newspaper), that the whole
      book is an allegory on the search after happiness. I think
      this fits in beautifully in many ways&mdash;particularly about
      the bathing-machines: when the people get weary of life,
      and can't find happiness in towns or in books, then they
      rush off to the seaside, to see what bathing-machines will
      do for them.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. H. Holiday, in a very interesting article on "The
      Snark's Significance" (<i>Academy,</i> January 29, 1898),
      quoted the inscription which Mr. Dodgson had written in a
      vellum-bound, presentation-copy of the book. It is so
      characteristic that I take the liberty of reproducing it
      here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Presented to Henry Holiday, most patient of artists, by
      Charles L. Dodgson, most exacting, but not most ungrateful
      of authors, March 29, 1876.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A little girl, to whom Mr. Dodgson had given a copy of the
      "Snark," managed to get the whole poem off by heart, and
      insisted on reciting, it from beginning to end during a
      long carriage-drive. Her friends, who, from the nature of
      the case, were unable to escape, no doubt wished that she,
      too, was a Boojum.

    <p>
      During the year, the first public dramatic representation
      of "Alice in Wonderland" was given at the Polytechnic, the
      entertainment taking the form of a series of
      <i>tableaux</i>, interspersed with appropriate readings and
      songs. Mr. Dodgson exercised a rigid censorship over all
      the extraneous matter introduced into the performance, and
      put his veto upon a verse in one of the songs, in which the
      drowning of kittens was treated from the humorous point of
      view, lest the children in the audience might learn to
      think lightly of death in the case of the lower animals.

      Mr. Dodgson's love of the drama was not, as I have shown, a
      taste which he acquired in later years. From early college
      days he never missed anything which he considered worth
      seeing at the London theatres. I believe he used to
      reproach himself&mdash;unfairly, I think&mdash;with spending too much
      time on such recreations. For a man who worked so hard and
      so incessantly as he did; for a man to whom vacations meant
      rather a variation of mental employment than absolute rest
      of mind, the drama afforded just the sort of relief that
      was wanted. His vivid imagination, the very earnestness and
      intensity of his character enabled him to throw himself
      utterly into the spirit of what he saw upon the stage, and
      to forget in it all the petty worries and disappointments
      of life. The old adage says that a man cannot burn the
      candle at both ends; like most proverbs, it is only
      partially true, for often the hardest worker is the man who
      enters with most zest into his recreations, and this was
      emphatically the case with Mr. Dodgson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Pater, in his book on the Renaissance, says (I quote
      from rough notes only), "A counted number of pulses only is
      given to us of a variegated dramatic life. How may we see
      in them all that is to be seen in them by the finest
      senses? How shall we pass most swiftly from point to point,
      and be present always at the focus where the greatest
      number of vital forces unite in their purest energy? To
      burn always with this hard gem-like flame, to maintain this
      ecstasy, is success in life." Here we have the truer
      philosophy, here we have the secret of Lewis Carroll's
      life. He never wasted time on social formalities; he
      refused to fulfil any of those (so called) duties which
      involve ineffable boredom, and so his mind was always fresh
      and ready. He said in one of his letters that he hoped that
      in the next world all knowledge would not be given to us
      suddenly, but that we should gradually grow wiser, for the
      <i>acquiring</i> knowledge was to him the real pleasure.
      What is this but a paraphrase of another of Pater's
      thoughts, "Not the fruit of experience, but experience
      itself is the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, times without number, he allowed himself to be
      carried away by emotion as he saw life in the mirror of the
      stage; but, best of all, he loved to see the acting of
      children, and he generally gave copies of his books to any
      of the little performers who specially pleased him. On
      January 13, 1877, he wrote in his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Went up to town for the day, and took E&mdash; with me to the
      afternoon pantomime at the Adelphi, "Goody Two-Shoes,"
      acted entirely by children. It was a really charming
      performance. Little Bertie Coote, aged ten, was clown&mdash;a
      wonderfully clever little fellow; and Carrie Coote, about
      eight, was Columbine, a very pretty graceful little thing.
      In a few years' time she will be just <i>the</i> child to
      act "Alice," if it is ever dramatised. The harlequin was a
      little girl named Gilchrist, one of the most beautiful
      children, in face and figure, that I have ever seen. I must
      get an opportunity of photographing her. Little Bertie
      Coote, singing "Hot Codlings," was curiously like the
      pictures of Grimaldi.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It need hardly be said that the little girl was Miss
      Constance Gilchrist. Mr. Dodgson sent her a copy of "Alice
      in Wonderland," with a set of verses on her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people object altogether to children appearing on the
      stage; it is said to be bad for their morals as well as for
      their health. A letter which Mr. Dodgson once wrote in the
      <i>St. James's Gazette</i> contains a sufficient refutation
      of the latter fancy:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I spent yesterday afternoon at Brighton, where for five
      hours I enjoyed the society of three exceedingly happy and
      healthy little girls, aged twelve, ten, and seven. I think
      that any one who could have seen the vigour of life in
      those three children&mdash;the intensity with which they enjoyed
      everything, great or small, that came in their way&mdash;who
      could have watched the younger two running races on the
      Pier, or have heard the fervent exclamation of the eldest
      at the end of the afternoon, "We <i>have</i> enjoyed
      ourselves!" would have agreed with me that here, at least,
      there was no excessive "physical strain," nor any
      <i>imminent</i> danger of "fatal results"! A drama, written
      by Mr. Savile Clarke, is now being played at Brighton, and
      in this (it is called "Alice in Wonderland") all three
      children have been engaged. They had been acting every
      night this week, and <i>twice</i> on the day before I met
      them, the second performance lasting till half-past ten at
      night, after which they got up at seven next morning to
      bathe! That such (apparently) severe work should co-exist
      with blooming health and buoyant spirits seems at first
      sight a paradox; but I appeal to any one who has ever
      worked <i>con amore</i> at any subject whatever to support
      me in the assertion that, when you really love the subject
      you are working at, the "physical strain" is absolutely
      <i>nil</i>; it is only when working "against the grain"
      that any strain is felt, and I believe the apparent paradox
      is to be explained by the fact that a taste for
      <i>acting</i> is one of the strongest passions of human
      nature, that stage-children show it nearly from infancy,
      and that, instead of being miserable drudges who ought to
      be celebrated in a new "Cry of the Children," they simply
      <i>rejoice</i> in their work "even as a giant rejoiceth to
      run his course."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodgson's general views on the mission of the drama are
      well shown by an extract from a circular which he sent to
      many of his friends in 1882:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The stage (as every playgoer can testify) is an engine of
      incalculable power for influencing society; and every
      effort to purify and ennoble its aims seems to me to
      deserve all the countenance that the great, and all the
      material help that the wealthy, can give it; while even
      those who are neither great nor wealthy may yet do their
      part, and help to&mdash;<br>
      <blockquote>
        "Ring out the darkness of the land,<br>
        Ring in the Christ that is to be."
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I do not know if Mr. Dodgson's suggested amendment of some
      lines in the "Merchant of Venice" was ever carried out, but
      it further illustrates the serious view he took of this
      subject. The hint occurs in a letter to Miss Ellen Terry,
      which runs as follows:&mdash;

      You gave me a treat on Saturday such as I have very seldom
      had in my life. You must be weary by this time of hearing
      your own praises, so I will only say that Portia was all I
      could have imagined, and more. And Shylock is
      superb&mdash;especially in the trial-scene.<br>
      <br>
      Now I am going to be very bold, and make a suggestion,
      which I do hope you will think well enough of to lay it
      before Mr. Irving. I want to see that clause omitted (in
      the sentence on Shylock)&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        <br>
        That, for this favour,<br>
        He presently become a Christian;
      </blockquote>It is a sentiment that is entirely horrible
      and revolting to the feelings of all who believe in the
      Gospel of Love. Why should our ears be shocked by such
      words merely because they are Shakespeare's? In his day,
      when it was held to be a Christian's duty to force his
      belief on others by fire and sword&mdash;to burn man's body in
      order to save his soul&mdash;the words probably conveyed no
      shock. To all Christians now (except perhaps extreme
      Calvinists) the idea of forcing a man to abjure his
      religion, whatever that religion may be, is (as I have
      said) simply horrible.<br>
      <br>
      I have spoken of it as a needless outrage on religious
      feeling: but surely, being so, it is a great artistic
      mistake. Its tendency is directly contrary to the spirit of
      the scene. We have despised Shylock for his avarice, and we
      rejoice to see him lose his wealth: we have abhorred him
      for his bloodthirsty cruelty, and we rejoice to see him
      baffled. And now, in the very fulness of our joy at the
      triumph of right over wrong, we are suddenly called on to
      see in him the victim of a cruelty a thousand times worse
      than his own, and to honour him as a martyr. This, I am
      sure, Shakespeare never meant. Two touches only of sympathy
      does he allow us, that we may realise him as a man, and not
      as a demon incarnate. "I will not pray with you"; "I had it
      of Leah, when I was a bachelor." But I am sure he never
      meant our sympathies to be roused in the supreme moment of
      his downfall, and, if he were alive now, I believe he would
      cut out those lines about becoming a Christian.<br>
      <br>
      No interpolation is needed&mdash;(I should not like to suggest
      the putting in a single word that is not Shakespeare's)&mdash;I
      would read the speech thus:&mdash;<br>
      <blockquote>
        <br>
        That lately stole his daughter:<br>
        Provided that he do record a gift,<br>
        Here in the court, &amp;c.
      </blockquote>And I would omit Gratiano's three lines at
      Shylock's exit, and let the text stand:&mdash;<br>
      <blockquote>
        <i>Duke</i>: "Get thee gone, but do it." (<i>Exit
        Shylock</i>.)
      </blockquote>The exit, in solemn silence, would be, if
      possible, even grander than it now is, and would lose
      nothing by the omission of Gratiano's flippant jest....

      On January 16th he saw "New Men and Old Acres" at the Court
      Theatre. The two authors of the pieces, Dubourg and Tom
      Taylor, were great friends of his. "It was a real treat,"
      he writes, "being well acted in every detail. Ellen Terry
      was wonderful, and I should think unsurpassable in all but
      the lighter parts." Mr. Dodgson himself had a strong wish
      to become a dramatic author, but, after one or two
      unsuccessful attempts to get his plays produced, he wisely
      gave up the idea, realising that he had not the necessary
      constructive powers. The above reference to Miss Ellen

      She and her sister, Miss Kate Terry, were among the
      distinguished people whom he photographed. The first time
      he saw the latter actress was, I think, in 1858, when she
      was playing in "The Tempest" at the Princess's. "The gem of
      the piece," he writes, "was the exquisitely graceful and
      beautiful Ariel, Miss Kate Terry. Her appearance as a
      sea-nymph was one of the most beautiful living pictures I
      ever saw, but this, and every other one in my recollection
      (except Queen Katherine's dream), were all outdone by the
      concluding scene, where Ariel is left alone, hovering over
      the wide ocean, watching the retreating ship. It is an
      innovation on Shakespeare, but a worthy one, and the
      conception of a true poet."

      Mr. Dodgson was a frequent contributor to the daily Press.
      As a rule his letters appeared in the <i>St. James's
      Gazette</i>, for the editor, Mr. Greenwood, was a friend of
      his, but the following sarcastic epistle was an exception:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      NATURAL SCIENCE AT OXFORD.<br>
      <br>
      <i>To the Editor of the "Pall Mall Gazette."</i><br>
      <br>
      Sir,&mdash;There is no one of the many ingenious appliances of
      mechanical science that is more appreciated or more
      successfully employed than the wedge; so subtle and
      imperceptible are the forces needed for the insertion of
      its "thin end," so astounding the results which its "thick
      end" may ultimately produce. Of the former process we shall
      see a beautiful illustration in a Congregation to be holden
      at Oxford on the 24th inst., when it will be proposed to
      grant, to those who have taken the degrees of bachelor and
      master in Natural Science only, the same voting powers as
      in the case of the "M.A." degree. This means the omission
      of one of the two classical languages, Latin and Greek,
      from what has been hitherto understood as the curriculum of
      an Oxford education. It is to this "thin end" of the wedge
      that I would call the attention of our non-residents, and
      of all interested in Oxford education, while the "thick
      end" is still looming in the distance. But why fear a
      "thick end" at all? I shall be asked. Has Natural Science
      shown any such tendency, or given any reason to fear that
      such a concession would lead to further demands? In answer
      to that question, let me sketch, in dramatic fashion, the
      history of her recent career in Oxford. In the dark ages of
      our University (some five-and-twenty years ago), while we
      still believed in classics and mathematics as constituting
      a liberal education, Natural Science sat weeping at our
      gates. "Ah, let me in!" she moaned; "why cram reluctant
      youth with your unsatisfying lore? Are they not hungering
      for bones; yea, panting for sulphuretted hydrogen?" We
      heard and we pitied. We let her in and housed her royally;
      we adorned her palace with re-agents and retorts, and made
      it a very charnel-house of bones, and we cried to our
      undergraduates, "The feast of Science is spread! Eat,
      drink, and be happy!" But they would not. They fingered the
      bones, and thought them dry. They sniffed at the hydrogen,
      and turned away. Yet for all that Science ceased not to
      cry, "More gold, more gold!" And her three fair daughters,
      Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (for the modern horse-leech
      is more prolific than in the days of Solomon), ceased not
      to plead, "Give, give!" And we gave; we poured forth our
      wealth like water (I beg her pardon, like H<sub>2</sub>O),
      and we could not help thinking there was something weird
      and uncanny in the ghoul-like facility with which she
      absorbed it.<br>
      <br>
      The curtain rises on the second act of the drama. Science
      is still weeping, but this time it is for lack of pupils,
      not of teachers or machinery. "We are unfairly
      handicapped!" she cries. "You have prizes and scholarships
      for classics and mathematics, and you bribe your best
      students to desert us. Buy us some bright, clever boys to
      teach, and then see what we can do!" Once more we heard and
      pitied. We had bought her bones; we bought her boys. And
      now at last her halls were filled&mdash;not only with teachers
      paid to teach, but also with learners paid to learn. And we
      have not much to complain of in results, except that
      perhaps she is a little too ready to return on our hands
      all but the "honour-men"&mdash;all, in fact, who really need the
      helping hand of an educator. "Here, take back your stupid
      ones!" she cries. "Except as subjects for the scalpel (and
      we have not yet got the Human Vivisection Act through
      Parliament) we can do nothing with them!"<br>
      <br>
      The third act of the drama is yet under rehearsal; the
      actors are still running in and out of the green-room, and
      hastily shuffling on their new and ill-fitting dresses; but
      its general scope is not far to seek. At no distant day our
      once timid and tearful guest will be turning up her nose at
      the fare provided for her. "Give me no more youths to
      teach," she will say; "but pay me handsomely, and let me
      think. Plato and Aristotle were all very well in their way;
      Diogenes and his tub for me!" The allusion is not
      inappropriate. There can be little doubt that some of the
      researches conducted by that retiring philosopher in the
      recesses of that humble edifice were strictly scientific,
      embracing several distinct branches of entomology. I do not
      mean, of course, that "research" is a new idea in Oxford.
      From time immemorial we have had our own chosen band of
      researchers (here called "professors"), who have advanced
      the boundaries of human knowledge in many directions. True,
      they are not left so wholly to themselves as some of these
      modern thinkers would wish to be, but are expected to give
      some few lectures, as the outcome of their "research" and
      the evidence of its reality, but even that condition has
      not always been enforced&mdash;for instance, in the case of the
      late Professor of Greek, Dr. Gaisford, the University was
      too conscious of the really valuable work he was doing in
      philological research to complain that he ignored the usual
      duties of the chair and delivered no lectures.<br>
      <br>
      And, now, what is the "thick end" of the wedge? It is that
      Latin and Greek may <i>both</i> vanish from our curriculum;
      that logic, philosophy, and history may follow; and that
      the destinies of Oxford may some day be in the hands of
      those who have had no education other than "scientific."
      And why not? I shall be asked. Is it not as high a form of
      education as any other? That is a matter to be settled by
      facts. I can but offer my own little item of evidence, and
      leave it to others to confirm or to refute. It used once to
      be thought indispensable for an educated man that he should
      be able to write his own language correctly, if not
      elegantly; it seems doubtful how much longer this will be
      taken as a criterion. Not so many years ago I had the
      honour of assisting in correcting for the press some pages
      of the <i>Anthropological Review</i>, or some such
      periodical. I doubt not that the writers were eminent men
      in their own line; that each could triumphantly prove, to
      his own satisfaction, the unsoundness of what the others
      had advanced; and that all would unite in declaring that
      the theories of a year ago were entirely exploded by the
      latest German treatise; but they were not able to set forth
      these thoughts, however consoling in themselves, in
      anything resembling the language of educated society. In
      all my experience, I have never read, even in the "local
      news" of a country paper, such slipshod, such deplorable
      English.<br>
      <br>
      I shall be told that I am ungenerous in thus picking out a
      few unfavourable cases, and that some of the greatest minds
      of the day are to be found in the ranks of science. I
      freely admit that such may be found, but my contention is
      that <i>they</i> made the science, not the science them;
      and that in any line of thought they would have been
      equally distinguished. As a general principle, I do not
      think that the exclusive study of any <i>one</i> subject is
      really education; and my experience as a teacher has shown
      me that even a considerable proficiency in Natural Science,
      taken alone, is so far from proving a high degree of
      cultivation and great natural ability that it is fully
      compatible with general ignorance and an intellect quite
      below par. Therefore it is that I seek to rouse an
      interest, beyond the limits of Oxford, in preserving
      classics as an essential feature of a University education.
      Nor is it as a classical tutor (who might be suspected of a
      bias in favour of his own subject) that I write this. On
      the contrary, it is as one who has taught science here for
      more than twenty years (for mathematics, though
      good-humouredly scorned by the biologists on account of the
      abnormal certainty of its conclusions, is still reckoned
      among the sciences) that I beg to sign myself,&mdash;Your
      obedient servant,<br>

    <p>
      I give the above letter because I think it amusing; it must
      not be supposed that the writer's views on the subject
      remained the same all through his life. He was a thorough
      Conservative, and it took a long time to reconcile him to
      any new departure. In a political discussion with a friend
      he once said that he was "first an Englishman, and then a
      Conservative," but however much a man may try to put
      patriotism before party, the result will be but partially
      successful, if patriotism would lead him into opposition to
      the mental bias which has originally made him either a
      Conservative or a Radical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took, of course, great pleasure in the success of his
      books, as every author must; but the greatest pleasure of
      all to him was to know that they had pleased others. Notes
      like the following are frequent in his Diary: "<i>June</i>
      25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Spent the afternoon in sending off seventy
      circulars to Hospitals, offering copies of 'Alice' and the
      'Looking-Glass' for sick children." He well deserved the
      name which one of his admirers gave him&mdash;"The man who loved
      little children."
    </p>
    <p>
      In April, 1878, he saw a performance of "Olivia" at the
      Court Theatre. "The gem of the piece is Olivia herself,
      acted by Ellen Terry with a sweetness and pathos that moved
      some of the audience (nearly including myself) to tears.
      Her leave-taking was exquisite; and when, in her exile, she
      hears that her little brother had cried at the mention of
      her name, her exclamation 'Pet!' was tenderness itself.
      Altogether, I have not had a greater dramatic treat for a
      long time. <i>Dies cret&#226; notandus</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      I see that I have marked for quotation the following brief
      entries in the Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Aug. 4th</i> (at Eastbourne).&mdash;Went, morning and
      evening, to the new chapel-of-ease belonging to S.
      Saviour's. It has the immense advantage of <i>not</i> being
      crowded; but this scarcely compensates for the vile
      Gregorian chants, which vex and weary one's ear.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Aug. 17th</i>.&mdash;A very inquisitive person, who had some
      children with her, found out my name, and then asked me to
      shake hands with her child, as an admirer of my books: this
      I did, unwisely perhaps, as I have no intention of
      continuing the acquaintance of a "Mrs. Leo Hunter."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Dec. 23rd</i>.&mdash;I have been making a plan for work next
      term, of this kind: Choose a subject (<i>e.g</i>.,
      "Circulation," "Journeys of S. Paul," "English Counties")
      for each week. On Monday write what I know about it; during
      week get up subject; on Saturday write again; put the two
      papers away, and six months afterwards write again and
      compare.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As an artist, Mr. Dodgson possessed an intense natural
      appreciation of the beautiful, an abhorrence of all that is
      coarse and unseemly which might almost be called
      hyper-refinement, a wonderfully good eye for form, and
      last, but not least, the most scrupulous conscientiousness
      about detail. On the other hand his sense of colour was
      somewhat imperfect, and his hand was almost totally
      untrained, so that while he had all the enthusiasm of the
      true artist, his work always had the defects of an amateur.

      It was at the end of December, 1878, that a letter, written
      in a singularly legible and rather boyish-looking hand,
      came to me from Christ Church, Oxford, signed "C. L.
      Dodgson." The writer said that he had come across some
      fairy designs of mine, and he should like to see some more
      of my work. By the same post came a letter from my London

      friend, I felt less restraint than one usually feels in
      writing to a stranger, though I carefully concealed my
      knowledge of his identity, as he had not chosen to reveal
      it.<br>
      <br>
      This was the beginning of a frequent and delightful
      correspondence, and as I confessed to a great love for
      fairy lore of every description, he asked me if I would
      accept a child's fairy-tale book he had written, called
      "Alice in Wonderland." I replied that I knew it nearly all
      off by heart, but that I should greatly prize a copy given
      to me by himself. By return came "Alice," and "Through the
      Looking-Glass," bound most luxuriously in white calf and
      gold.<br>
      <br>
      And this is the graceful and kindly note that came with
      them: "I am now sending you 'Alice,' and the
      'Looking-Glass' as well. There is an incompleteness about
      giving only one, and besides, the one you bought was
      probably in red and would not match these. If you are at
      all in doubt as to what to do with the (now) superfluous
      copy, let me suggest your giving it to some poor sick
      child. I have been distributing copies to all the hospitals
      and convalescent homes I can hear of, where there are sick
      children capable of reading them, and though, of course,
      one takes some pleasure in the popularity of the books
      elsewhere, it is not nearly so pleasant a thought to me as
      that they may be a comfort and relief to children in hours
      of pain and weariness. Still, no recipient <i>can</i> be
      more appropriate than one who seems to have been in
      fairyland herself, and to have seen, like the 'weary
      mariners' of old&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        'Between the green brink and the running foam<br>
        White limbs unrobed in a crystal air,<br>
        Sweet faces, rounded arms, and bosoms prest<br>
        To little harps of gold.'"
      </blockquote><br>
      "Do you ever come to London?" he asked in another letter;
      "if so, will you allow me to call upon you?"<br>
      <br>
      Early in the summer I came up to study, and I sent him word
      that I was in town. One night, coming into my room, after a
      long day spent at the British Museum, in the half-light I
      saw a card lying on the table. "Rev. C. L. Dodgson."
      Bitter, indeed, was my disappointment at having missed him,
      but just as I was laying it sadly down I spied a small T.O.
      in the corner. On the back I read that he couldn't get up
      to my rooms early or late enough to find me, so would I
      arrange to meet him at some museum or gallery the day but
      one following? I fixed on South Kensington Museum, by the
      "Schliemann" collection, at twelve o'clock.<br>
      <br>
      A little before twelve I was at the rendezvous, and then
      the humour of the situation suddenly struck me, that
      <i>I</i> had not the ghost of an idea what <i>he</i> was
      like, nor would <i>he</i> have any better chance of
      discovering <i>me!</i> The room was fairly full of all
      sorts and conditions, as usual, and I glanced at each
      masculine figure in turn, only to reject it as a
      possibility of the one I sought. Just as the big clock had
      clanged out twelve, I heard the high vivacious voices and
      laughter of children sounding down the corridor.<br>
      <br>
      At that moment a gentleman entered, two little girls
      clinging to his hands, and as I caught sight of the tall
      slim figure, with the clean-shaven, delicate, refined face,
      I said to myself, "<i>That's</i> Lewis Carroll." He stood
      for a moment, head erect, glancing swiftly over the room,
      then, bending down, whispered something to one of the
      children; she, after a moment's pause, pointed straight at
      me.<br>
      <br>
      Dropping their hands he came forward, and with that winning
      smile of his that utterly banished the oppressive sense of
      the Oxford don, said simply, "I am Mr. Dodgson; I was to
      meet you, I think?" To which I as frankly smiled, and said,
      "How did you know me so soon?"<br>
      <br>
      "My little friend found you. I told her I had come to meet
      a young lady who knew fairies, and she fixed on you at
      once. But <i>I</i> knew you before she spoke."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This acquaintance ripened into a true, artistic friendship,
      which lasted till Mr. Dodgson's death. In his first letter
      to Miss Thomson he speaks of himself as one who for twenty
      years had found his one amusement in photographing from
      life&mdash;especially photographing children; he also said that
      he had made attempts ("most unsuccessfully") at drawing
      them. When he got to know her more intimately, he asked her
      to criticise his work, and when she wrote expressing her
      willingness to do so, he sent her a pile of sketch-books,
      through which she went most carefully, marking the
      mistakes, and criticising, wherever criticism seemed to be
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he might often have been seen in her studio,
      lying flat on his face, and drawing some child-model who
      had been engaged for his especial benefit. "I <i>love</i>
      the effort to draw," he wrote in one of his letters to her,
      "but I utterly fail to please even my own eye&mdash;tho' now and
      then I seem to get somewhere <i>near</i> a right line or
      two, when I have a live child to draw from. But I have no
      time left now for such things. In the next life, I do
      <i>hope</i> we shall not only <i>see</i> lovely forms, such
      as this world does not contain, but also be able to
      <i>draw</i> them."
    </p>
    <p>
      But while he fully recognised the limits of his powers, he
      had great faith in his own critical judgment; and with good
      reason, for his perception of the beautiful in contour and
      attitude and grouping was almost unerring. All the drawings
      which Miss Thomson made for his "Three Sunsets" were
      submitted to his criticism, which descended to the smallest
      details. He concludes a letter to her, which contained the
      most elaborate and minute suggestions for the improvement
      of one of these pictures, with the following words: "I make
      all these suggestions with diffidence, feeling that I have
      <i>really no</i> right at all, as an amateur, to criticise
      the work of a real artist."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following extract from another letter to Miss Thomson
      shows that seeking after perfection, that discontent with
      everything short of the best, which was so marked a feature
      of his character. She had sent him two drawings of the head
      of some child-friend of his:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Your note is a puzzle&mdash;you say that "No. 2 would have been
      still more like if the paper had been exactly the same
      shade&mdash;but I'd no more at hand of the darker colour." Had I
      given you the impression that I was in a <i>hurry</i>, and
      was willing to have No. 2 <i>less</i> good than it
      <i>might</i> be made, so long as I could have it
      <i>quick?</i> If I did, I'm very sorry: I never
      <i>meant</i> to say a word like it: and, if you had written
      "I could make it still more like, on darker paper; but I've
      no more at hand. How long can you wait for me to get some?"
      I should have replied, "Six weeks, or six <i>months</i>, if
      you prefer it!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have already spoken of his love of nature, as opposed to
      the admiration for the morbid and abnormal. "I want you,"
      he writes to Miss Thomson, "to do my fairy drawings from
      <i>life</i>. They would be very pretty, no doubt, done out
      of your own head, but they will be ten times as valuable if
      done from life. Mr. Furniss drew the pictures of 'Sylvie'
      from life. Mr. Tenniel is the only artist, who has drawn
      for me, who resolutely refused to use a model, and declared
      he no more needed one than I should need a
      multiplication-table to work a mathematical problem!" On
      another occasion he urges the importance of using models,
      in order to avoid the similarity of features which would
      otherwise spoil the pictures: "Cruikshank's splendid
      illustrations were terribly spoiled by his having only
      <i>one</i> pretty female face in them all. Leech settled
      down into <i>two</i> female faces. Du Maurier, I think, has
      only <i>one</i>, now. All the ladies, and all the little
      girls in his pictures look like twin sisters."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting to know that Sir Noel Paton and Mr.
      Walter Crane were, in Lewis Carroll's opinion, the most
      successful drawers of children: "There are but few artists
      who seem to draw the forms of children <i>con amore</i>.
      Walter Crane is perhaps the best (always excepting Sir Noel
      Paton): but the thick outlines, which he insists on using,
      seem to take off a good deal from the beauty of the
      result."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held that no artist can hope to effect a higher type of
      beauty than that which life itself exhibits, as the
      following words show:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I don't quite understand about fairies losing "grace," if
      too like human children. Of course I grant that to be like
      some <i>actual</i> child is to lose grace, because no
      living child is perfect in form: many causes have lowered
      the race from what God made it. But the <i>perfect</i>
      human form, free from these faults, is surely equally
      applicable to men, and fairies, and angels? Perhaps that is
      what you mean&mdash;that the Artist can imagine, and design, more
      perfect forms than we ever find in life?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have already referred several times to Miss Ellen Terry
      as having been one of Mr. Dodgson's friends, but he was
      intimate with the whole family, and used often to pay them
      a visit when he was in town. On May 15, 1879, he records a
      very curious dream which he had about Miss Marion ("Polly")
      Terry:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Last night I had a dream which I record as a curiosity, so
      far as I know, in the literature of dreams. I was staying,
      with my sisters, in some suburb of London, and had heard
      that the Terrys were staying near us, so went to call, and
      found Mrs. Terry at home, who told us that Marion and
      Florence were at the theatre, "the Walter House," where
      they had a good engagement. "In that case," I said, "I'll
      go on there at once, and see the performance&mdash;and may I take
      Polly with me?" "Certainly," said Mrs. Terry. And there was
      Polly, the child, seated in the room, and looking about
      nine or ten years old: and I was distinctly conscious of
      the fact, yet without any feeling of surprise at its
      incongruity, that I was going to take the <i>child</i>
      Polly with me to the theatre, to see the <i>grown-up</i>
      Polly act! Both pictures&mdash;Polly as a child, and Polly as a
      woman, are, I suppose, equally clear in my ordinary waking
      memory: and it seems that in sleep I had contrived to give
      the two pictures separate individualities.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Of all the mathematical books which Mr. Dodgson wrote, by
      far the most elaborate, if not the most original, was
      "Euclid and His Modern Rivals." The first edition was
      issued in 1879, and a supplement, afterwards incorporated
      into the second edition, appeared in 1885.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, as the author says, has for its object
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      to furnish evidence (1) that it is essential for the
      purposes of teaching or examining in Elementary Geometry to
      employ one text&mdash;book only; (2) that there are strong <i>a
      priori</i> reasons for retaining in all its main features,
      and especially in its sequence and numbering of
      Propositions, and in its treatment of Parallels, the Manual
      of Euclid; and (3) that no sufficient reasons have yet been
      shown for abandoning it in favour of any one of the modern
      Manuals which have been offered as substitutes.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The book is written in dramatic form, and relieved
      throughout by many touches in the author's happiest vein,
      which make it delightful not only to the scientific reader,
      but also to any one of average intelligence with the
      slightest sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the conclusions are accepted in their entirety or
      not, it is certain that the arguments are far more
      effective than if the writer had presented them in the form
      of an essay. Mr. Dodgson had a wide experience as a teacher
      and examiner, so that he knew well what he was writing
      about, and undoubtedly the appearance of this book has done
      very much to stay the hand of the innovator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene opens in a College study-time, midnight. Minos,
      an examiner, is discovered seated between two immense piles
      of manuscripts. He is driven almost to distraction in his
      efforts to mark fairly the papers sent up, by reason of the
      confusion caused through the candidates offering various
      substitutes for Euclid. Rhadamanthus, another equally
      distracted examiner, comes to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men consult together for a time, and then
      Rhadamanthus retires, and Minos falls asleep. Hereupon the
      Ghost of Euclid appears, and discusses with Minos the
      reasons for retaining his Manual as a whole, in its present
      order and arrangement. As they are mainly concerned with
      the wants of beginners, their attention is confined to
      Books I. and II.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must be content with one short extract from the
      dialogue:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Euclid</i>.&mdash;It is, I think, a friend of yours who has
      amused himself by tabulating the various Theorems which
      might be enunciated on the single subject of Pairs of
      Lines. How many did he make them out to be?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;About two hundred and fifty, I believe.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Euclid</i>.&mdash;At that rate there would probably be within
      the limit of my First Book&mdash;how many?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;A thousand at least.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Euclid</i>.&mdash;What a popular school-book it will be! How
      boys will bless the name of the writer who first brings out
      the complete thousand!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      With a view to discussing and criticising his various
      modern rivals, Euclid promises to send to Minos the ghost
      of a German Professor (Herr Niemand) who "has read all
      books, and is ready to defend any thesis, true or untrue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A charming companion!" as Minos drily remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings us to Act II., in which the Manuals which
      reject Euclid's treatment of Parallels are dealt with one
      by one. Those Manuals which adopt it are reserved for Act
      III., Scene i.; while in Scene ii., "The Syllabus of the
      Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching,"
      and Wilson's "Syllabus," come under review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one or two extracts need be given, which, it is hoped,
      will suffice to illustrate the character and style of the
      book:
    </p>
    <p>
      Act II., Scene v.&mdash;Niemand and Minos are arguing for and
      against Henrici's "Elementary Geometry."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;I haven't quite done with points yet. I find
      an assertion that they never jump. Do you think that arises
      from their having "position," which they feel might be
      compromised by such conduct?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;I cannot tell without hearing the passage
      read.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;It is this: "A point, in changing its
      position on a curve, passes in moving from one position to
      another through all intermediate positions. It does not
      move by jumps."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;That is quite true.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;Tell me then&mdash;is every centre of gravity a
      point?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;Certainly.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;Let us now consider the centre of gravity of
      a flea. Does it&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand (indignantly)</i>.&mdash;Another word, and I shall
      vanish! I cannot waste a night on such trivialities.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;I can't resist giving you just <i>one</i>
      more tit-bit&mdash;the definition of a square at page 123: "A
      quadrilateral which is a kite, a symmetrical trapezium, and
      a parallelogram is a square!" And now, farewell, Henrici:
      "Euclid, with all thy faults, I love thee still!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Again, from Act II., Scene vi.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;He (Pierce, another "Modern Rival,") has a
      definition of direction which will, I think, be new to you.
      <i>(Reads.)</i><br>
      <br>
      "The <i>direction of a line</i> in any part is the
      direction of a point at that part from the next preceding
      point of the line!"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;That sounds mysterious. Which way along a
      line are "preceding" points to be found?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;<i>Both ways.</i> He adds, directly
      afterwards, "A line has two different directions,"
      &amp;c.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;So your definition needs a postscript.... But
      there is yet another difficulty. How far from a point is
      the "next" point?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Niemand</i>.&mdash;At an infinitely small distance, of course.
      You will find the matter fully discussed in my work on the
      Infinitesimal Calculus.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Minos</i>.&mdash;A most satisfactory answer for a teacher to
      make to a pupil just beginning Geometry!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Act IV. Euclid reappears to Minos, "followed by the
      ghosts of Archimedes, Pythagoras, &amp;c., who have come to
      see fair play." Euclid thus sums up his case:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "'The cock doth craw, the day doth daw,' and all
      respectable ghosts ought to be going home. Let me carry
      with me the hope that I have convinced you of the necessity
      of retaining my order and numbering, and my method of
      treating Straight Lines, Angles, Right Angles, and (most
      especially) Parallels. Leave me these untouched, and I
      shall look on with great contentment while other changes
      are made&mdash;while my proofs are abridged and improved&mdash;while
      alternative proofs are appended to mine&mdash;and while new
      Problems and Theorems are interpolated. In all these
      matters my Manual is capable of almost unlimited
      improvement."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Appendices I. and II. Mr. Dodgson quotes the opinions of
      two eminent mathematical teachers, Mr. Todhunter and
      Professor De Morgan, in support of his argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving this subject I should like to refer to a
      very novel use of Mr. Dodgson's book&mdash;its employment in a
      school. Mr. G. Hopkins, Mathematical Master in the High
      School at Manchester, U.S., and himself the author of a
      "Manual of Plane Geometry," has so employed it in a class
      of boys aged from fourteen or fifteen upwards. He first
      called their attention to some of the more prominent
      difficulties relating to the question of Parallels, put a
      copy of Euclid in their hands, and let them see his
      treatment of them, and after some discussion placed before
      them Mr. Dodgson's "Euclid and His Modern Rivals" and "New
      Theory of Parallels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is the fact that American boys are sharper than
      English, but at any rate the youngsters are reported to
      have read the two books with an earnestness and a
      persistency that were as gratifying to their instructor as
      they were complimentary to Mr. Dodgson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June of the same year an entry in the Diary refers to a
      proposal in Convocation to allow the University Club to
      have a cricket-ground in the Parks. This had been proposed
      in 1867, and then rejected. Mr. Dodgson sent round to the
      Common Rooms copies of a poem on "The Deserted Parks,"
      which had been published by Messrs. Parker in 1867, and
      which was afterwards included in "Notes by an Oxford
      Chiel." I quote the first few lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>

      Readers of "Sylvie and Bruno" will remember the way in
      which the invisible fairy-children save the drunkard from
      his evil life, and I have always felt that Mr. Dodgson
      meant Sylvie to be something more than a fairy&mdash;a sort of
      guardian angel. That such an idea would not have been
      inconsistent with his way of looking at things is shown by
      the following letter:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ch. Ch., <i>July</i>, 1879.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Ethel,&mdash;I have been long intending to answer your
      letter of April 11th, chiefly as to your question in
      reference to Mrs. N&mdash;'s letter about the little S&mdash;s [whose
      mother had recently died]. You say you don't see "how they
      can be guided aright by their dead mother, or how light can
      come from her." Many people believe that our friends in the
      other world can and do influence us in some way, and
      perhaps even "guide" us and give us light to show us our
      duty. My own feeling is, it <i>may</i> be so: but nothing
      has been revealed about it. That the angels do so <i>is</i>
      revealed, and we may feel sure of <i>that</i>; and there is
      a beautiful fancy (for I don't think one can call it more)
      that "a mother who has died leaving a child behind her in
      this world, is allowed to be a sort of guardian angel to
      that child." Perhaps Mrs. N&mdash; believes that.

      In February, 1880, Mr. Dodgson proposed to the Christ
      Church "Staff-salaries Board," that as his tutorial work
      was lighter he should have &#163;200 instead of &#163;300
      a year. It is not often that a man proposes to cut down
      <i>his own</i> salary, but the suggestion in this case was
      intended to help the College authorities in the policy of
      retrenchment which they were trying to carry out.

      horses, and the caravan he lived in. And I added to my
      theatrical experiences by a chat with a couple of circus
      children&mdash;Ada Costello, aged 9, and Polly (Evans, I think),
      aged 13. I found Ada in the outer tent, with the pony on
      which she was to perform&mdash;practising vaulting on to it,
      varied with somersaults on the ground. I showed her my wire

      <i>Sept. 2nd</i>.&mdash;Mrs. H&mdash; took me to Dr. Bell's (the old

      "training children." It was a curious affair. First a very
      long hymn; then two very long extempore prayers (not by
      Lord R&mdash;), which were strangely self-sufficient and wanting
      in reverence. Lord R&mdash;'s remarks were commonplace enough,
      though some of his theories were new, but, I think, not
      true&mdash;<i>e.g.,</i> that encouraging emulation in schoolboys,
      or desiring that they should make a good position in life,
      was un-Christian. I escaped at the first opportunity after
      his speech, and went down on the beach, where I made
      acquaintance with a family who were banking up with sand
      the feet and legs of a pretty little girl perched on a
      sand-castle. I got her father to make her stand to be
      drawn. Further along the beach a merry little mite began

      A little book, published during this year, "Alice (a
      dramatic version of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice'), and other
      Fairy Tales for Children," by Mrs. Freiligrath-Kroeker, was
      very successful, and, I understand, still has a regular
      sale. Mr. Dodgson most gladly gave his consent to the
      dramatisation of his story by so talented an authoress, and
      shortly afterwards Mrs. Kroeker brought out "Through the

      disturbers were nearly all out-College men.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodgson sent a letter to <i>The Observer</i> on this
      subject:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Sir,&mdash;Your paper of May 29th contains a leading article on
      Christ Church, resting on so many mis-statements of fact
      that I venture to appeal to your sense of justice to allow
      me, if no abler writer has addressed you on the subject, an
      opportunity of correcting them. It will, I think, be found
      that in so doing I shall have removed the whole foundation
      on which the writer has based his attack on the House,
      after which I may contentedly leave the superstructure to
      take care of itself. "Christ Church is always provoking the
      adverse criticism of the outer world." The writer justifies
      this rather broad generalisation by quoting three instances
      of such provocation, which I will take one by one.<br>
      <br>
      At one time we are told that "The Dean ... neglects his
      functions, and spends the bulk of his time in Madeira." The
      fact is that the Dean's absence from England more than
      twenty years ago during two successive winters was a sad
      necessity, caused by the appearance of symptoms of grave
      disease, from which he has now, under God's blessing,
      perfectly recovered.<br>
      <br>
      The second instance occurred eleven years ago, when some of
      the undergraduates destroyed some valuable statuary in the
      Library. Here the writer states that the Dean first
      announced that criminal proceedings would be taken, and
      then, on discovering that the offenders were "highly
      connected," found himself "converted to the opinion that
      mercy is preferable to stern justice, and charity to the
      strict letter of the law." The facts are that the
      punishment awarded to the offenders was deliberated on and
      determined on by the Governing Body, consisting of the
      Dean, the Canons, and some twenty Senior Students; that
      their deliberations were most assuredly in no way affected
      by any thoughts of the offenders being "highly connected";
      and that, when all was over, we had the satisfaction of
      seeing ourselves roundly abused in the papers on both
      sides, and charged with having been too lenient, and also
      with having been too severe.<br>
      <br>
      The third instance occurred the other night. Some
      undergraduates were making a disturbance, and the Junior
      Censor "made his appearance in person upon the scene of
      riot," and "was contumeliously handled." Here the only
      statement of any real importance, the alleged assault by
      Christ Church men on the Junior Censor, is untrue. The fact
      is that nearly all the disturbers were out-College men,
      and, though it is true that the Censor was struck by a
      stone thrown from a window, the unenviable distinction of
      having thrown it belongs to no member of the House. I doubt
      if we have one single man here who would be capable of so
      base and cowardly an act.<br>
      <br>
      The writer then gives us a curious account of the present
      constitution of the House. The Dean, whom he calls "the
      right reverend gentleman," is, "in a kind of way, master of
      the College. The Canons, in a vague kind of way, are
      supposed to control the College." The Senior Students "dare
      not call their souls their own," and yet somehow dare "to
      vent their wrath" on the Junior Students. His hazy, mental
      picture of the position of the Canons may be cleared up by
      explaining to him that the "control" they exercise is
      neither more nor less than that of any other six members of
      the Governing Body. The description of the Students I pass
      over as not admitting any appeal to actual facts.<br>
      <br>
      The truth is that Christ Church stands convicted of two
      unpardonable crimes&mdash;being great, and having a name. Such a
      place must always expect to find itself "a wide mark for
      scorn and jeers"&mdash;a target where the little and the nameless
      may display their skill. Only the other day an M.P., rising
      to ask a question about Westminster School, went on to
      speak of Christ Church, and wound up with a fierce attack
      on the ancient House. Shall we blame him? Do we blame the
      wanton schoolboy, with a pebble in his hand, all powerless
      to resist the alluring vastness of a barndoor?<br>
      <br>
      The essence of the article seems to be summed up in the
      following sentence: "At Christ Church all attempts to
      preserve order by the usual means have hitherto proved
      uniformly unsuccessful, and apparently remain equally
      fruitless." It is hard for one who, like myself, has lived
      here most of his life, to believe that this is seriously
      intended as a description of the place. However, as general
      statements can only be met by general statements, permit
      me, as one who has lived here for thirty years and has
      taught for five-and-twenty, to say that in my experience
      order has been the rule, disorder the rare exception, and
      that, if the writer of your leading article has had an
      equal amount of experience in any similar place of
      education, and has found a set of young men more
      gentlemanly, more orderly, and more pleasant in every way
      to deal with, than I have found here, I cannot but think
      him an exceptionally favoured mortal.&mdash;Yours, &amp;c.<br>
      <br>
      Charles l. Dodgson,<br>
      <br>
      <i>Student and Mathematical Lecturer of Christ Church</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In July began an amusing correspondence between Mr. Dodgson
      and a "circle-squarer," which lasted several months. Mr.
      Dodgson sent the infatuated person, whom we will call Mr.
      B&mdash;, a proof that the area of a circle is less than 3.15 the
      square of the radius. Mr. B&mdash;replied, "Your proof is not in
      accordance with Euclid, it assumes that a circle may be
      considered as a rectangle, and that two right lines can
      enclose a space." He returned the proof, saying that he
      could not accept any of it as elucidating the exact area of
      a circle, or as Euclidean. As Mr. Dodgson's method involved
      a slight knowledge of trigonometry, and he had reason to
      suspect that Mr. B&mdash;was entirely ignorant of that subject,
      he thought it worth while to put him to the test by asking
      him a few questions upon it, but the circle-squarer, with
      commendable prudence, declined to discuss anything not
      Euclidean. Mr. Dodgson then wrote to him, "taking leave of
      the subject, until he should be willing to enlarge his
      field of knowledge to the elements of Algebraical
      Geometry." Mr. B&mdash;replied, with unmixed contempt,
      "Algebraical Geometry is all moon-shine." <i>He</i>
      preferred "weighing cardboard" as a means of ascertaining
      exact truth in mathematical research. Finally he suggested
      that Mr. Dodgson might care to join in a prize-competition
      to be got up among the followers of Euclid, and as he
      apparently wished him to understand that he (Mr. B&mdash;) did
      not think much of his chances of getting a prize, Mr.
      Dodgson considered that the psychological moment for
      putting an end to the correspondence had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he was beginning to feel his regular College
      duties a terrible clog upon his literary work. The
      Studentship which he held was not meant to tie him down to
      lectures and examinations. Such work was very well for a
      younger man; he could best serve "the House" by his
      literary fame.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>July</i> 14<i>th.</i>&mdash;Came to a more definite decision
      than I have ever yet done&mdash;that it is about time to resign
      the Mathematical Lectureship. My chief motive for holding
      on has been to provide money for others (for myself, I have
      been many years able to retire), but even the &#163;300 a
      year I shall thus lose I may fairly hope to make by the
      additional time I shall have for book-writing. I think of
      asking the G.B. (Governing Body) next term to appoint my
      successor, so that I may retire at the end of the year,
      when I shall be close on fifty years old, and shall have
      held the Lectureship for exactly 26 years. (I had the
      Honourmen for the last two terms of 1855, but was not full
      Lecturer till Hilary, 1856.)<br>
      <br>
      <i>Oct</i>. 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;I have just taken an important
      step in life, by sending to the Dean a proposal to resign
      the Mathematical Lectureship at the end of this year. I
      shall now have my whole time at my own disposal, and, if
      God gives me life and continued health and strength, may
      hope, before my powers fail, to do some worthy work in
      writing&mdash;partly in the cause of mathematical education,
      partly in the cause of innocent recreation for children,
      and partly, I hope (though so utterly unworthy of being
      allowed to take up such work) in the cause of religious
      thought. May God bless the new form of life that lies
      before me, that I may use it according to His holy
      will!<br>
      <br>
      <i>Oct. 21st</i>.&mdash;I had a note in the evening from the
      Dean, to say that he had seen the Censors on the subject of
      my proposed resignation at the end of the year, and that
      arrangements should be made, as far as could be done, to
      carry out my wishes; and kindly adding an expression of
      regret at losing my services, but allowing that I had
      "earned a right to retirement." So my Lectureship seems to
      be near its end.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Nov. 30th</i>.&mdash;I find by my Journal that I gave my
      <i>first</i> Euclid Lecture in the Lecture-room on Monday,
      January 28, 1856. It consisted of twelve men, of whom nine
      attended. This morning, I have given what is most probably
      my <i>last</i>: the lecture is now reduced to nine, of whom
      all attended on Monday: this morning being a Saint's Day,
      the attendance was voluntary, and only two appeared&mdash;E.H.
      Morris, and G. Lavie. I was Lecturer when the <i>father</i>
      of the latter took his degree, viz., in 1858.<br>
      <br>
      There is a sadness in coming to the end of anything in
      life. Man's instincts cling to the Life that will never
      end.<br>
      <br>
      <i>May 30, 1882.</i>&mdash;Called on Mrs. R&mdash;. During a good part
      of the evening I read <i>The Times</i>, while the party
      played a round game of spelling words&mdash;a thing I will never
      join in. Rational conversation and <i>good</i> music are
      the only things which, to me, seem worth the meeting for,
      for grown-up people.<br>
      <br>
      <i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;Went out with Charsley, and did four miles
      on one of his velocimans, very pleasantly.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The velociman was an early and somewhat cumbrous form of
      tricycle; Mr. Dodgson made many suggestions for its
      improvement. He never attempted to ride a bicycle, however,
      but, in accordance with his own dictum, "In youth, try a
      bicycle, in age, buy a tricycle," confined himself to the
      three-wheeled variety.

    <blockquote>
      <i>Nov. 8th</i>.&mdash;Whitehead, of Trinity, told us a charming
      story in Common Room of a father and son. They came up
      together: the son got into a College&mdash;the father had to go
      to New Inn Hall: the son passed Responsions, while his
      father had to put off: finally, the father failed in Mods
      and has gone down: the son will probably take his degree,
      and may then be able to prepare his father for another
      try.<br>

      During this year he composed the words of a song,

    <blockquote>
      I found myself seated, with many others, in darkness, in a
      large amphitheatre. Deep stillness prevailed. A kind of
      hushed expectancy was upon us. We sat awaiting I know not
      what. Before us hung a vast and dark curtain, and between
      it and us was a kind of stage. Suddenly an intense wish
      seized me to look upon the forms of some of the heroes of
      past days. I cannot say whom in particular I longed to
      behold, but, even as I wished, a faint light flickered over
      the stage, and I was aware of a silent procession of
      figures moving from right to left across the platform in
      front of me. As each figure approached the left-hand corner
      it turned and gazed at me, and I knew (by what means I
      cannot say) its name. One only I recall&mdash;Saint George; the
      light shone with a peculiar blueish lustre on his shield
      and helmet as he turned and slowly faced me. The figures
      were shadowy, and floated like mist before me; as each one
      disappeared an invisible choir behind the curtain sang the
      "Dream music." I awoke with the melody ringing in my ears,
      and the words of the last line complete&mdash;"I see the shadows
      falling, and slowly pass away." The rest I could not
      recall.

      One of the best services to education which Mr. Dodgson
      performed was his edition of "Euclid I. and II.," which was
      published in 1882. In writing "Euclid and His Modern
      Rivals," he had criticised somewhat severely the various
      substitutes proposed for Euclid, so far as they concerned
      beginners; but at the same time he had admitted that within
      prescribed limits Euclid's text is capable of amendment and
      improvement, and this is what he attempted to do in this
      book. That he was fully justified is shown by the fact that
      during the years 1882&mdash;1889 the book ran through eight
      editions. In the Introduction he enumerates, under the
      three headings of "Additions," "Omissions," and
      "Alterations," the chief points of difference between his
      own and the ordinary editions of Euclid, with his reasons
      for adopting them. They are the outcome of long experience,
      and the most conservative of teachers would readily accept
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of I. 24, for example, is decidedly better and
      more satisfactory than the ordinary proof, and the
      introduction of the definition of "projection" certainly
      simplifies the cumbrous enunciations of II. 12 and 13.
      Again, the alternative proof of II. 8, suggested in the
      Introduction, is valuable, and removes all excuse for
      omitting this proposition, as is commonly clone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figures used are from the blocks prepared for the late
      Mr. Todhunter's well-known edition of Euclid, to which Mr.
      Dodgson's manual forms an excellent stepping-stone.

    <p>
      At the beginning of 1883 he went up to town to see the
      collection of D. G. Rossetti's pictures in the Burlington
      Gallery. He was especially struck with "Found," which he
      thus describes&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A picture of a man finding, in the streets of London, a
      girl he had loved years before in the days of her
      innocence. She is huddled up against the wall, dressed in
      gaudy colours, and trying to turn away her agonised face,
      while he, holding her wrists, is looking down with an
      expression of pain and pity, condemnation and love, which
      is one of the most marvellous things I have ever seen done
      in painting.<br>

      course, to give members of Common Room an opportunity of
      deciding what wines should be bought.]<br>

      sending round a "carte" of herself; she sent a cabinet. She

      In 1883 Lewis Carroll was advised to make a stand against
      the heavy discount allowed by publishers to booksellers,
      and by booksellers to the public. Accordingly the following
      notice began to appear in all his books: "In selling Mr.
      Lewis Carroll's books to the Trade, Messrs. Macmillan and
      Co. will abate 2d. in the shilling (no odd copies), and
      allow 5 per cent, discount within six months, and 10 per
      cent, for cash. In selling them to the Public (for cash
      only) they will allow 10 per cent, discount."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bold step to take, and elicited some loud
      expressions of disapproval. "Rather than buy on the terms
      Mr. Lewis Carroll offers," "A Firm of London Booksellers"
      wrote in <i>The Bookseller</i> of August 4th, "the trade
      will do well to refuse to take copies of his books, new or
      old, so long as he adheres to the terms he has just
      announced to the trade for their delectation and delight."
      On the other hand, an editorial, which appeared in the same
      number of <i>The Bookseller,</i> expressed warm approval of
      the innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid all possible misconceptions, the author fully
      explained his views in a little pamphlet on "The Profits of
      Authorship." He showed that the bookseller makes as much
      profit out of every volume he sells (assuming the buyer to
      pay the full published price, which he did in those days
      more readily than he does to-day) as author and publisher
      together, whereas his share in the work is very small. He
      does not say much about the author's part in the work&mdash;that
      it is a very heavy one goes without saying&mdash;but in
      considering the publisher's share he says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The publisher contributes about as much as the bookseller
      in time and bodily labour, but in mental toil and trouble a
      great deal more. I speak with some personal knowledge of
      the matter, having myself, for some twenty years, inflicted
      on that most patient and painstaking firm, Messrs.
      Macmillan and Co., about as much wear and worry as ever
      publishers have lived through. The day when they undertake
      a book for me is a <i>dies nefastus</i> for them. From that
      day till the book is out&mdash;an interval of some two or three
      years on an average&mdash;there is no pause in "the pelting of
      the pitiless storm" of directions and questions on every
      conceivable detail. To say that every question gets a
      courteous and thoughtful reply&mdash;that they are still outside
      a lunatic asylum&mdash;and that they still regard me with some
      degree of charity&mdash;is to speak volumes in praise of their
      good temper and of their health, bodily and mental. I think
      the publisher's claim on the profits is on the whole
      stronger than the booksellers.
    </blockquote>

      "Rhyme? and Reason?" appeared at Christmas; the dedicatory
      verses, inscribed "To a dear child: in memory of golden
      summer hours and whispers of a summer sea," were addressed
      to a little friend of the author's, Miss Gertrude Chataway.
      One of the most popular poems in the book is "Hiawatha's
      Photographing," a delicious parody of Longfellow's
      "Hiawatha." "In an age of imitation," says Lewis Carroll,
      in a note at the head, "I can claim no special merit for
      this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy."
      It is not every one who has read this note who has observed
      that it is really in the same metre as the poem below it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another excellent parody, "Atalanta in Camden-Town,"
      exactly hit off the style of that poet who stands alone and
      unapproached among the poets of the day, and whom Mr.
      Dodgson used to call "the greatest living master of
      language."

      "Fame's Penny Trumpet," affectionately dedicated to all

      The moaning of some tortured hound.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Lewis Carroll thus addresses them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Fill all the air with hungry wails&mdash;<br>
      "Reward us, ere we think or write!<br>
      Without your gold mere knowledge fails<br>
      To sate the swinish appetite!"<br>
      <br>
      And, where great Plato paced serene,<br>
      Or Newton paused with wistful eye,<br>
      Rush to the chase with hoofs unclean<br>
      And Babel-clamour of the stye!<br>
      <br>
      Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise:<br>
      We will not rob them of their due,<br>
      Nor vex the ghosts of other days<br>
      By naming them along with you.<br>
      <br>
      They sought and found undying fame:<br>
      They toiled not for reward nor thanks:<br>
      Their cheeks are hot with honest shame<br>
      For you, the modern mountebanks!

      "For auld lang syne" the author sent a copy of his book to
      Mrs. Hargreaves (Miss Alice Liddell), accompanied by a
      short note.

    <blockquote>

      The beginning of 1884 was chiefly occupied in Common Room
      business. The Curatorship seems to have been anything but a
      sinecure. Besides weightier responsibilities, it involved
      the care of the Common Room Cat! In this case the "care"
      ultimately killed the cat&mdash;but not until it had passed the
      span of life usually allotted to those animals, and beyond
      which their further existence is equally a nuisance to
      themselves and to every one else. As to the best way of
      "terminating its sublunary existence," Mr. Dodgson
      consulted two surgeons, one of whom was Sir James Paget. I
      do not know what method was finally adopted, but I am sure
      it was one that gave no pain to pussy's nerves, and as
      little as possible to her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On March 11th there was a debate in Congregation on the
      proposed admission of women to some of the Honour Schools
      at Oxford. This was one of the many subjects on which Mr.
      Dodgson wrote a pamphlet. During the debate he made one of
      his few speeches, and argued strongly against the proposal,
      on the score of the injury to health which it would inflict
      upon the girl-undergraduates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the month he and the Rev. E.F. Sampson, Tutor of
      Christ Church, paid a visit to Jersey, seeing various
      friends, notably the Rev. F.H. Atkinson, an old College
      friend of Mr. Dodgson's, who had helped him when he was
      editor of <i>College Rhymes</i>. I quote a few lines from a
      letter of his to Mr. Atkinson, as showing his views on
      matrimony:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      So you have been for twelve years a married man, while I am
      still a lonely old bachelor! And mean to keep so, for the
      matter of that. College life is by no means unmixed misery,
      though married life has no doubt many charms to which I am
      a stranger.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A note in his Diary on May 5th shows one of the changes in
      his way of life which advancing years forced him to make:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Wrote to&mdash;(who had invited me to dine) to beg off, on the
      ground that, in my old age, I find dinner parties more and
      more fatiguing. This is quite a new departure. I much
      grudge giving an evening (even if it were not tiring) to
      bandying small-talk with dull people.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The next extract I give does not look much like old age!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I called on Mrs. M&mdash;. She was out; and only one maid in,
      who, having come to the gate to answer the bell, found the
      door blown shut on her return. The poor thing seemed really
      alarmed and distressed. However, I got a man to come from a
      neighbouring yard with a ladder, and got in at the
      drawing-room window&mdash;a novel way of entering a friend's
      house!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, almost exactly the same thing happened to him
      in 1888: "The door blew shut, with the maid outside, and no
      one in the house. I got the cook of the next house to let
      me go through their premises, and with the help of a pair
      of steps got over the wall between the two back-yards."
    </p>
    <p>
      In July there appeared an article in the <i>St. James's
      Gazette</i> on the subject of "Parliamentary Elections,"
      written by Mr. Dodgson. It was a subject in which he was
      much interested, and a few years before he had contributed
      a long letter on the "Purity of Elections" to the same
      newspaper. I wish I had space to give both in full; as
      things are, a summary and a few extracts are all I dare
      attempt. The writer held that there are a great number of
      voters, and <i>pari passu</i> a great number of
      constituencies, that like to be on the winning side, and
      whose votes are chiefly influenced by that consideration.
      The ballot-box has made it practically impossible for the
      individual voter to know which is going to be the winning
      side, but after the first few days of a general election,
      one side or the other has generally got a more or less
      decided advantage, and a weak-kneed constituency is sorely
      tempted to swell the tide of victory.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      But this is not all. The evil extends further than to the
      single constituency; nay, it extends further than to a
      single general election; it constitutes a feature in our
      national history; it is darkly ominous for the future of
      England. So long as general elections are conducted as at
      present we shall be liable to oscillations of political
      power, like those of 1874 and 1880, but of ever-increasing
      violence&mdash;one Parliament wholly at the mercy of one
      political party, the next wholly at the mercy of the
      other&mdash;while the Government of the hour, joyfully hastening
      to undo all that its predecessors have done, will wield a
      majority so immense that the fate of every question will be
      foredoomed, and debate will be a farce; in one word, we
      shall be a nation living from hand to mouth, and with no
      settled principle&mdash;an army, whose only marching orders will
      be "Right about face!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      His remedy was that the result of each single election
      should be kept secret till the general election is over:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It surely would involve no practical difficulty to provide
      that the boxes of voting papers should be sealed up by a
      Government official and placed in such custody as would
      make it impossible to tamper with them; and that when the
      last election had been held they should be opened, the
      votes counted, and the results announced.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The article on "Parliamentary Elections" proposed much more
      sweeping alterations. The opening paragraph will show its
      general purport:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The question, how to arrange our constituencies and conduct
      our Parliamentary elections so as to make the House of
      Commons, as far as possible, a true index of the state of
      opinion in the nation it professes to represent, is surely
      equal in importance to any that the present generation has
      had to settle. And the leap in the dark, which we seem
      about to take in a sudden and vast extension of the
      franchise, would be robbed of half its terrors could we
      feel assured that each political party will be duly
      represented in the next Parliament, so that every side of a
      question will get a fair hearing.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The axioms on which his scheme was based were as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      (1) That each Member of Parliament should represent
      approximately the same number of electors.<br>
      <br>
      (2) That the minority of the two parties into which,
      broadly speaking, each district may be divided, should be
      adequately represented.<br>
      <br>
      (3) That the waste of votes, caused by accidentally giving
      one candidate more than he needs and leaving another of the
      same party with less than he needs, should be, if possible,
      avoided.<br>
      <br>
      (4) That the process of marking a ballot-paper should be
      reduced to the utmost possible simplicity, to meet the case
      of voters of the very narrowest mental calibre.<br>
      <br>
      (5) That the process of counting votes should be as simple
      as possible.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Then came a precise proposal. I do not pause to compare it
      in detail with the suggestions of Mr. Hare, Mr. Courtney,
      and others:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I proceed to give a summary of rules for the method I
      propose. Form districts which shall return three, four, or
      more Members, in proportion to their size. Let each elector
      vote for one candidate only. When the poll is closed,
      divide the total number of votes by the number of Members
      to be returned <i>plus</i> one, and take the next greater
      integer as "quota." Let the returning officer publish the
      list of candidates, with the votes given for each, and
      declare as "returned" each that has obtained the quota. If
      there are still Members to return, let him name a time when
      all the candidates shall appear before him; and each
      returned Member may then formally assign his surplus votes
      to whomsoever of the other candidates he will, while the
      other candidates may in like manner assign their votes to
      one another.<br>
      <br>
      This method would enable each of the two parties in a
      district to return as many Members as it could muster
      "quotas," no matter how the votes were distributed. If, for
      example, 10,000 were the quota, and the "reds" mustered
      30,000 votes, they could return three Members; for, suppose
      they had four candidates, and that A had 22,000 votes, B
      4,000, C 3,000, D 1,000, A would simply have to assign
      6,000 votes to B and 6,000 to C; while D, being hopeless of
      success, would naturally let C have his 1,000 also. There
      would be no risk of a seat being left vacant through two
      candidates of the same party sharing a quota between
      them&mdash;an unwritten law would soon come to be recognised&mdash;that
      the one with fewest votes should give place to the other.
      And, with candidates of two opposite parties, this
      difficulty could not arise at all; one or the other could
      always be returned by the surplus votes of his party.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some notes from the Diary for March, 1885, are worth
      reproducing here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>March</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Sent off two letters of literary
      importance, one to Mrs. Hargreaves, to ask her consent to
      my publishing the original MS. of "Alice" in facsimile (the
      idea occurred to me the other day); the other to Mr. H.
      Furniss, a very clever illustrator in <i>Punch</i>, asking
      if he is open to proposals to draw pictures for me.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The letter to Mrs. Hargreaves, which, it will be noticed,
      was earlier in date than the short note already quoted in
      this chapter, ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My Dear Mrs. Hargreaves,&mdash;I fancy this will come to you
      almost like a voice from the dead, after so many years of
      silence, and yet those years have made no difference that I
      can perceive in <i>my</i> clearness of memory of the days
      when we <i>did</i> correspond. I am getting to feel what an
      old man's failing memory is as to recent events and new
      friends, (for instance, I made friends, only a few weeks
      ago, with a very nice little maid of about twelve, and had
      a walk with her&mdash;and now I can't recall either of her
      names!), but my mental picture is as vivid as ever of one
      who was, through so many years, my ideal child-friend. I
      have had scores of child-friends since your time, but they
      have been quite a different thing.<br>
      <br>
      However, I did not begin this letter to say all
      <i>that</i>. What I want to ask is, Would you have any
      objection to the original MS. book of "Alice's Adventures"
      (which I suppose you still possess) being published in
      facsimile? The idea of doing so occurred to me only the
      other day. If, on consideration, you come to the conclusion
      that you would rather <i>not</i> have it done, there is an
      end of the matter. If, however, you give a favourable
      reply, I would be much obliged if you would lend it me
      (registered post, I should think, would be safest) that I
      may consider the possibilities. I have not seen it for
      about twenty years, so am by no means sure that the
      illustrations may not prove to be so awfully bad that to
      reproduce them would be absurd.<br>
      <br>
      There can be no doubt that I should incur the charge of
      gross egoism in publishing it. But I don't care for that in
      the least, knowing that I have no such motive; only I
      think, considering the extraordinary popularity the books
      have had (we have sold more than 120,000 of the two), there
      must be many who would like to see the original form.<br>
      <br>
      Always your friend,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.

      The letter to Harry Furniss elicited a most satisfactory
      reply. Mr. Furniss said that he had long wished to
      illustrate one of Lewis Carroll's books, and that he was
      quite prepared to undertake the work ("Sylvie and Bruno").

      Two more notes from the Diary, referring to the same month
      follow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>March 10th</i>.&mdash;A great Convocation assembled in the
      theatre, about a proposed grant for Physiology, opposed by
      many (I was one) who wish restrictions to be enacted as to
      the practice of vivisection for research. Liddon made an
      excellent speech against the grant, but it was carried by
      412 to 244.<br>
      <br>
      <i>March 29th</i>.&mdash;Never before have I had so many literary
      projects on hand at once. For curiosity, I will here make a
      list of them.<br>
      <br>
      (1) Supplement to "Euclid and Modern Rivals."<br>
      <br>
      (2) 2nd Edition of "Euc. and Mod. Rivals."<br>
      <br>
      (3) A book of Math. curiosities, which I think of calling
      "Pillow Problems, and other Math. Trifles." This will
      contain Problems worked out in the dark, Logarithms without
      Tables, Sines and angles do., a paper I am now writing on
      "Infinities and Infinitesimals," condensed Long
      Multiplication, and perhaps others.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Euclid V.<br>
      <br>
      (5) "Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers," which is nearly
      complete, and gives actual proof of limits 3.14158,
      3.14160.<br>
      <br>
      (6) A symbolical Logic, treated by my algebraic method.<br>
      <br>
      (7) "A Tangled Tale."<br>
      <br>
      (8) A collection of Games and Puzzles of my devising, with
      fairy pictures by Miss E.G. Thomson. This might also
      contain my "Mem. Tech." for dates; my "Cipher-writing"
      scheme for Letter-registration, &amp;c., &amp;c.<br>
      <br>
      (9) Nursery Alice.<br>
      <br>
      (10) Serious poems in "Phantasmagoria."<br>
      <br>
      (11) "Alice's Adventures Underground."<br>
      <br>
      (12) "Girl's Own Shakespeare." I have begun on
      "Tempest."<br>
      <br>
      (13) New edition of "Parliamentary Representation."<br>
      <br>
      (14) New edition of Euc. I., II.<br>
      <br>
      (15) The new child's book, which Mr. Furniss is to
      illustrate. I have settled on no name as yet, but it will
      perhaps be "Sylvie and Bruno."<br>
      <br>
      I have other shadowy ideas, <i>e.g.</i>, a Geometry for
      Boys, a vol. of Essays on theological points freely and
      plainly treated, and a drama on "Alice" (for which Mr.
      Mackenzie would write music): but the above is a fair
      example of "too many irons in the fire!"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A letter written about this time to his friend, Miss Edith
      Rix, gives some very good hints about how to work, all the
      more valuable because he had himself successfully carried
      them out. The first hint was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      When you have made a thorough and reasonably long effort,
      to understand a thing, and still feel puzzled by it,
      <i>stop</i>, you will only hurt yourself by going on. Put
      it aside till the next morning; and if <i>then</i> you
      can't make it out, and have no one to explain it to you,
      put it aside entirely, and go back to that part of the
      subject which you <i>do</i> understand. When I was reading
      Mathematics for University honours, I would sometimes,
      after working a week or two at some new book, and mastering
      ten or twenty pages, get into a hopeless muddle, and find
      it just as bad the next morning. My rule was <i>to begin
      the book again</i>. And perhaps in another fortnight I had
      come to the old difficulty with impetus enough to get over
      it. Or perhaps not. I have several books that I have begun
      over and over again.<br>
      <br>
      My second hint shall be&mdash;Never leave an unsolved difficulty
      <i>behind</i>. I mean, don't go any further in that book
      till the difficulty is conquered. In this point,
      Mathematics differs entirely from most other subjects.
      Suppose you are reading an Italian book, and come to a
      hopelessly obscure sentence&mdash;don't waste too much time on
      it, skip it, and go on; you will do very well without it.
      But if you skip a <i>mathematical</i> difficulty, it is
      sure to crop up again: you will find some other proof
      depending on it, and you will only get deeper and deeper
      into the mud.<br>
      <br>
      My third hint is, only go on working so long as the brain
      is <i>quite</i> clear. The moment you feel the ideas
      getting confused leave off and rest, or your penalty will
      be that you will never learn Mathematics <i>at all</i>!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Two more letters to the same friend are, I think, deserving
      of a place here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Eastbourne, <i>Sept</i>. 25, 1885.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Edith,&mdash;One subject you touch on&mdash;"the Resurrection
      of the Body"&mdash;is very interesting to me, and I have given it
      much thought (I mean long ago). <i>My</i> conclusion was to
      give up the <i>literal</i> meaning of the <i>material</i>
      body altogether. <i>Identity</i>, in some mysterious way,
      there evidently is; but there is no resisting the
      scientific fact that the actual <i>material</i> usable for
      <i>physical</i> bodies has been used over and over again&mdash;so
      that each atom would have several owners. The mere solitary
      fact of the existence of <i>cannibalism</i> is to my mind a
      sufficient <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the theory that
      the particular set of atoms I shall happen to own at death
      (changed every seven years, they say) will be mine in the
      next life&mdash;and all the other insuperable difficulties (such
      as people born with bodily defects) are swept away at once
      if we accept S. Paul's "spiritual body," and his simile of
      the grain of corn. I have read very little of "Sartor
      Resartus," and don't know the passage you quote: but I
      accept the idea of the material body being the "dress" of
      the spiritual&mdash;a dress needed for material life.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., <i>Dec</i>. 13, 1885.<br>
      <br>
      Dear Edith,&mdash;I have been a severe sufferer from
      <i>Logical</i> puzzles of late. I got into a regular tangle
      about the "import of propositions," as the ordinary logical
      books declare that "all <i>x</i> is <i>z</i>" doesn't even
      <i>hint</i> that any <i>x</i>'s exist, but merely that the
      qualities are so inseparable that, if ever <i>x</i> occurs,
      <i>z</i> must occur also. As to "some <i>x</i> is <i>z</i>"
      they are discreetly silent; and the living authorities I
      have appealed to, including our Professor of Logic, take
      opposite sides! Some say it means that the qualities are so
      connected that, if any <i>x</i>'s <i>did</i> exist, some
      <i>must</i> be <i>z</i>&mdash;others that it only means
      compatibility, <i>i.e.,</i> that some <i>might</i> be
      <i>z</i>, and they would go on asserting, with perfect
      belief in their truthfulness, "some boots are made of
      brass," even if they had all the boots in the world before
      them, and knew that <i>none</i> were so made, merely
      because there is no inherent impossibility in making boots
      of brass! Isn't it bewildering? I shall have to mention all
      this in my great work on Logic&mdash;but <i>I</i> shall take the
      line "any writer may mean exactly what he pleases by a
      phrase so long as he explains it beforehand." But I shall
      not venture to assert "some boots are made of brass" till I
      have found a pair! The Professor of Logic came over one day
      to talk about it, and we had a long and exciting argument,
      the result of which was "<i>x &mdash;x</i>"&mdash;a magnitude which you
      will be able to evaluate for yourself.<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As an example of the good advice Mr. Dodgson used to give
      his young friends, the following letter to Miss Isabel
      Standen will serve excellently:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Eastbourne, <i>Aug</i>. 4, 1885.<br>
      <br>
      I can quite understand, and much sympathise with, what you
      say of your feeling lonely, and not what you can honestly
      call "happy." Now I am going to give you a bit of
      philosophy about that&mdash;my own experience is, that
      <i>every</i> new form of life we try is, just at first,
      irksome rather than pleasant. My first day or two at the
      sea is a little depressing; I miss the Christ Church
      interests, and haven't taken up the threads of interest
      here; and, just in the same way, my first day or two, when
      I get back to Christ Church, I miss the seaside pleasures,
      and feel with unusual clearness the bothers of
      business-routine. In all such cases, the true philosophy, I
      believe, is "<i>wait</i> a bit." Our mental nerves seem to
      be so adjusted that we feel <i>first</i> and most keenly,
      the <i>dis</i>&mdash;comforts of any new form of life; but, after
      a bit, we get used to them, and cease to notice them; and
      <i>then</i> we have time to realise the enjoyable features,
      which at first we were too much worried to be conscious
      of.<br>
      <br>
      Suppose you hurt your arm, and had to wear it in a sling
      for a month. For the first two or three days the discomfort
      of the bandage, the pressure of the sling on the neck and
      shoulder, the being unable to use the arm, would be a
      constant worry. You would feel as if all comfort in life
      were gone; after a couple of days you would be used to the
      new sensations, after a week you perhaps wouldn't notice
      them at all; and life would seem just as comfortable as
      ever.<br>
      <br>
      So my advice is, don't think about loneliness, or
      happiness, or unhappiness, for a week or two. Then "take
      stock" again, and compare your feelings with what they were
      two weeks previously. If they have changed, even a little,
      for the better you are on the right track; if not, we may
      begin to suspect the life does not suit you. But what I
      want <i>specially</i> to urge is that there's no use in
      comparing one's feelings between one day and the next; you
      must allow a reasonable interval, for the <i>direction
      of</i> change to show itself.<br>
      <br>
      Sit on the beach, and watch the waves for a few seconds;
      you say "the tide is coming in "; watch half a dozen
      successive waves, and you may say "the last is the lowest;
      it is going out." Wait a quarter of an hour, and compare
      its <i>average</i> place with what it was at first, and you
      will say "No, it is coming in after all." ...<br>
      <br>
      With love, I am always affectionately yours,<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.

    <p>
      The next event to chronicle in Lewis Carroll's Life is the
      publication, by Messrs. Macmillan, of "A Tangled Tale," a
      series of mathematical problems which had originally
      appeared in the <i>Monthly Packet</i>. In addition to the
      problems themselves, the author added their correct
      solutions, with criticisms on the solutions, correct or
      otherwise, which the readers of the <i>Monthly Packet</i>
      had sent in to him. With some people this is the most
      popular of all his books; it is certainly the most
      successful attempt he ever made to combine mathematics and
      humour. The book was illustrated by Mr. A.B. Frost, who
      entered most thoroughly into the spirit of the thing. One
      of his pictures, "Balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to
      convince the dragon," is irresistibly comic. A short
      quotation will better enable the reader to understand the
      point of the joke:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel; the journey down
      had tried him, he said; so his two pupils had been the
      round of the place, in search of lodgings, without the old
      tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their
      childhood. They had named him after the hero of their Latin
      exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes about that
      versatile genius&mdash;anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was
      more than compensated by their sensational brilliance.
      "Balbus has overcome all his enemies" had been marked by
      their tutor, in the margin of the book, "Successful
      Bravery." In this way he had tried to extract a moral from
      every anecdote about Balbus&mdash;sometimes one of warning, as in
      "Balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon," against which he
      had written, "Rashness in Speculation "&mdash;sometimes of
      encouragement, as in the words, "Influence of Sympathy in
      United Action," which stood opposite to the anecdote
      "Balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the
      dragon"&mdash;and sometimes it dwindled down to a single word,
      such as "Prudence," which was all he could extract from the
      touching record that "Balbus, having scorched the tail of
      the dragon, went away." His pupils liked the short morals
      best, as it left them more room for marginal illustrations,
      and in this instance they required all the space they could
      get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Balbus and his pupils go in search of lodgings, which are
      only to be found in a certain square; at No. 52, one of the
      pupils supplements the usual questions by asking the
      landlady if the cat scratches:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure
      the cat was not listening. "I will not deceive you,
      gentlemen," she said. "It <i>do</i> scratch, but not
      without you pulls its whiskers! It'll never do it," she
      repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact
      words of some written agreement between herself and the
      cat, "without you pulls its whiskers!"<br>
      <br>
      "Much may be excused in a cat so treated," said Balbus as
      they left the house and crossed to No. 70, leaving the
      landlady curtesying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to
      herself her parting words, as if they were a form of
      blessing&mdash;"Not without you pulls its whiskers!"

      They secure one room at each of the following numbers&mdash;the
      square contains 20 doors on each side&mdash;Nine, Twenty-five,
      Fifty-two, and Seventy-three. They require three bedrooms
      and one day-room, and decide to take as day&mdash;room the one
      that gives them the least walking to do to get to it. The
      problem, of course, is to discover which room they adopted

      and few, if any of them, can be untied without a good deal
      of thought.

      Owing, probably, to the strain of incessant work, Mr.
      Dodgson about this period began to be subject to a very
      peculiar, yet not very uncommon, optical delusion, which
      takes the form of seeing moving fortifications. Considering
      the fact that he spent a good twelve hours out of every
      twenty-four in reading and writing, and that he was now
      well over fifty years old, it was not surprising that
      nature should begin to rebel at last, and warn him of the
      necessity of occasional rest.

      Some verses on "Wonderland" by "One who loves Alice,"
      appeared in the Christmas number of <i>Sylvia's Home
      Journal</i>, 1885. They were written by Miss M.E. Manners,
      and, as Lewis Carroll himself admired them, they will, I
      think, be read with interest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      WONDERLAND.<br>
      <br>
      How sweet those happy days gone by,<br>
      Those days of sunny weather,<br>
      When Alice fair, with golden hair,<br>
      And we&mdash;were young together;&mdash;<br>
      When first with eager gaze we scann'd<br>
      The page which told of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      On hearthrug in the winter-time<br>
      We lay and read it over;<br>
      We read it in the summer's prime,<br>
      Amidst the hay and clover.<br>
      The trees, by evening breezes fann'd,<br>
      Murmured sweet tales of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      We climbed the mantelpiece, and broke<br>
      The jars of Dresden china;<br>
      In Jabberwocky tongue we spoke,<br>
      We called the kitten "Dinah!"<br>
      And, oh! how earnestly we planned<br>
      To go ourselves to Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      The path was fringed with flowers rare,<br>
      With rainbow colours tinted;<br>
      The way was "up a winding stair,"<br>
      Our elders wisely hinted.<br>
      We did not wish to understand<br>
      <i>Bed</i> was the road to Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      We thought we'd wait till we should grow<br>
      Stronger as well as bolder,<br>
      But now, alas! full well we know<br>
      We're only growing older.<br>
      The key held by a childish hand,<br>
      Fits best the door of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      Yet still the Hatter drinks his tea,<br>
      The Duchess finds a moral,<br>
      And Tweedledum and Tweedledee<br>
      Forget in fright their quarrel.<br>
      The Walrus still weeps on the sand,<br>
      That strews the shores of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      And other children feel the spell<br>
      Which once we felt before them,<br>
      And while the well-known tale we tell,<br>
      We watch it stealing o'er them:<br>
      Before their dazzled eyes expand<br>
      The glorious realms of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, "time is fleet," and we have gained<br>
      Years more than twice eleven;<br>
      Alice, dear child, hast thou remained<br>
      "Exactually" seven?<br>
      With "proper aid," "two" could command<br>
      Time to go back in Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      Or have the years (untouched by charms),<br>
      With joy and sorrow laden,<br>
      Rolled by, and brought unto thy arms<br>
      A dainty little maiden?<br>
      Another Alice, who shall stand<br>
      By thee to hear of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      Carroll! accept the heartfelt thanks<br>
      Of children of all ages,<br>
      Of those who long have left their ranks,<br>
      Yet still must love the pages<br>
      Written by him whose magic wand<br>
      Called up the scenes of Wonderland.<br>
      <br>
      Long mayst thou live, the sound to hear<br>
      Which most thy heart rejoices,<br>
      Of children's laughter ringing clear,<br>
      And children's merry voices,<br>
      Until for thee an angel-hand<br>
      Draws back the veil of Wonderland.<br>

      Three letters, written at the beginning of 1886 to Miss
      Edith Rix, to whom he had dedicated "A Tangled Tale," are
      interesting as showing the deeper side of his character:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Guildford, <i>Jan</i>. 15, 1886.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Edith,&mdash;I have been meaning for some time to write
      to you about agnosticism, and other matters in your letter
      which I have left unnoticed. And yet I do not know, much as
      what you say interests me, and much as I should like to be
      of use to any wandering seeker after truth, that I am at
      all likely to say anything that will be new to you and of
      any practical use.<br>
      <br>
      The Moral Science student you describe must be a beautiful
      character, and if, as you say, she lives a noble life,
      then, even though she does not, as yet, see any God, for
      whose sake she can do things, I don't think you need be
      unhappy about her. "When thou wast under the fig tree, I
      saw thee," is often supposed to mean that Nathanael had
      been <i>praying</i>, praying no doubt ignorantly and
      imperfectly, but yet using the light he had: and it seems
      to have been accepted as faith in the Messiah. More and
      more it seems to me (I hope you won't be <i>very</i> much
      shocked at me as an ultra "Broad" Churchman) that what a
      person <i>is</i> is of more importance in God's sight than
      merely what propositions he affirms or denies. <i>You</i>,
      at any rate, can do more good among those new friends of
      yours by showing them what a Christian <i>is</i>, than by
      telling them what a Christian <i>believes</i>....<br>
      <br>
      I have a deep dread of argument on religious topics: it has
      many risks, and little chance of doing good. You and I will
      never <i>argue</i>, I hope, on any controverted religious
      question: though I do hope we may see the day when we may
      freely <i>speak</i> of such things, even where we happen to
      hold different views. But even then I should have no
      inclination, if we did differ, to conclude that my view was
      the right one, and to try to convert you to it....<br>
      <br>
      Now I come to your letter dated Dec. 22nd, and must scold
      you for saying that my solution of the problem was "quite
      different <i>to</i> all common ways of doing it": if
      <i>you</i> think that's good English, well and good; but
      <i>I</i> must beg to differ to you, and to hope you will
      <i>never</i> write me a sentence similar from this again.
      However, "worse remains behind"; and if you deliberately
      intend in future, when writing to me about one of England's
      greatest poets, to call him "Shelly," then all I can say
      is, that you and I will have to quarrel! Be warned in
      time.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., <i>Jan</i>. 26, 1886.<br>
      <br>
      My Dear Edith,&mdash;I am interested by what you say of Miss&mdash;.
      You will know, without my saying it, that if she, or any
      other friend of yours with any troubles, were to like to
      write to me, I would <i>very</i> gladly try to help: with
      all my ignorance and weakness, God has, I think, blessed my
      efforts in that way: but then His strength is made perfect
      in weakness....<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., <i>Feb</i>. 14, 1886.<br>
      <br>
      My Dear Edith,... I think I've already noticed, in a way,
      most of the rest of that letter&mdash;except what you say about
      learning more things "after we are dead." <i>I</i>
      certainly like to think that may be so. But I have heard
      the other view strongly urged, a good deal based on "then
      shall we know even as we are known." But I can't believe
      that that means we shall have <i>all</i> knowledge given us
      in a moment&mdash;nor can I fancy it would make me any happier:
      it is the <i>learning</i> that is the chief joy, here, at
      any rate....<br>
      <br>
      I find another remark anent "pupils"&mdash;a bold speculation
      that my 1,000 pupils may really "go on" in the future life,
      till they <i>have</i> really outstripped Euclid. And,
      please, what is <i>Euclid</i> to be doing all that time?
      ...<br>
      <br>
      One of the most dreadful things you have ever told me is
      your students' theory of going and speaking to any one they
      are interested in, without any introductions. This, joined
      with what you say of some of them being interested in
      "Alice," suggests the horrid idea of their some day walking
      into this room and beginning a conversation. It is enough
      to make one shiver, even to think of it!<br>
      <br>
      Never mind if people do say "Good gracious!" when you help
      old women: it <i>is</i> being, in some degree, both "good"
      <i>and</i> "gracious," one may hope. So the remark wasn't
      so inappropriate.<br>
      <br>
      I fear I agree with your friend in not liking all sermons.
      Some of them, one has to confess, are rubbish: but then I
      release my attention from the preacher, and go ahead in any
      line of thought he may have started: and his
      after-eloquence acts as a kind of accompaniment&mdash;like music
      while one is reading poetry, which often, to me, adds to
      the effect.<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The "Alice" operetta, which Mr. Dodgson had despaired of,
      was at last to become a reality. Mr. Savile Clarke wrote on
      August 28th to ask his leave to dramatise the two books,
      and he gladly assented. He only made one condition, which
      was very characteristic of him, that there should be "no
      <i>suggestion</i> even of coarseness in libretto or in
      stage business." The hint was hardly necessary, for Mr.
      Savile Clarke was not the sort of man to spoil his work, or
      to allow others to spoil it, by vulgarity. Several
      alterations were made in the books before they were
      suitable for a dramatic performance; Mr. Dodgson had to
      write a song for the ghosts of the oysters, which the
      Walrus and the Carpenter had devoured. He also completed
      "Tis the voice of the lobster," so as to make it into a
      song. It ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare<br>
      "You have baked me too brown: I must sugar my hair."<br>
      As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose<br>
      Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.<br>
      When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,<br>
      And talks with the utmost contempt of the shark;<br>
      But when the tide rises, and sharks are around,<br>
      His words have a timid and tremulous sound.<br>
      <br>
      I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,<br>
      How the owl and the panther were sharing a pie:<br>
      The panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,<br>
      And the owl had the dish for his share of the treat.<br>
      When the plate was divided, the owl, as a boon,<br>
      Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:<br>
      But the panther obtained both the fork and the knife,<br>
      So, when <i>he</i> lost his temper, the owl lost its life.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The play, for the first few weeks at least, was a great
      success. Some notes in Mr. Dodgson's Diary which relate to
      it, show how he appreciated Mr. Savile Clarke's venture:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Dec. 30th.</i>&mdash;To London with M&mdash;, and took her to "Alice
      in Wonderland," Mr. Savile Clarke's play at the Prince of
      Wales's Theatre. The first act (Wonderland) goes well,
      specially the Mad Tea Party. Mr. Sydney Harcourt is a
      capital Hatter, and little Dorothy d'Alcourt (&amp;aelig;t.
      6 1/2) a delicious Dormouse. Phoebe Carlo is a splendid
      Alice. Her song and dance with the Cheshire Cat (Master C.
      Adeson, who played the Pirate King in "Pirates of
      Penzance") was a gem. As a whole the play seems a
      success.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Feb</i>. 11, 1887.&mdash;Went to the "Alice" play, where we
      sat next a chatty old gentleman, who told me that the
      author of "Alice" had sent Phoebe Carlo a book, and that
      she had written to him to say that she would do her very
      best, and further, that he is "an Oxford man"&mdash;all which I
      hope I received with a sufficient expression of pleased
      interest.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Shortly before the production of the play, a Miss Whitehead
      had drawn a very clever medley-picture, in which nearly all
      Tenniel's wonderful creations&mdash;the Dormouse, the White
      Knight, the Mad Hatter, &amp;c.&mdash;appeared. This design was
      most useful as a "poster" to advertise the play. After the
      London run was over, the company made a tour of the
      provinces, where it met with a fair amount of success.

      At the end of 1886, "Alice's Adventures Underground," a
      facsimile of the original MS. book, afterwards developed
      into "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," with thirty-seven
      illustrations by the author, was published by Macmillan
      &amp; Co. A postscript to the Preface stated that any
      profits that might arise from the book would be given to
      Children's Hospitals and Convalescent Homes for Sick
      Children. Shortly before the book came out, Lewis Carroll
      wrote to Mrs. Hargreaves, giving a description of the
      difficulties that he had encountered in producing it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Christ Church, Oxford,<br>
      <br>
      <i>November</i> 11, 1886.<br>
      <br>
      My Dear Mrs. Hargreaves,&mdash;Many thanks for your permission to
      insert "Hospitals" in the Preface to your book. I have had
      almost as many adventures in getting that unfortunate
      facsimile finished, <i>Above</i> ground, as your namesake
      had <i>Under</i> it!<br>
      <br>
      First, the zincographer in London, recommended to me for
      photographing the book, page by page, and preparing the
      zinc-blocks, declined to undertake it unless I would
      entrust the book to <i>him</i>, which I entirely refused to
      do. I felt that it was only due to you, in return for your
      great kindness in lending so unique a book, to be
      scrupulous in not letting it be even <i>touched</i> by the
      workmen's hands. In vain I offered to come and reside in
      London with the book, and to attend daily in the studio, to
      place it in position to be photographed, and turn over the
      pages as required. He said that could not be done because
      "other authors' works were being photographed there, which
      must on no account be seen by the public." I undertook not
      to look at <i>anything</i> but my own book; but it was no
      use: we could not come to terms.<br>
      <br>
      Then &mdash; recommended me a certain Mr. X&mdash;, an excellent
      photographer, but in so small a way of business that I
      should have to <i>prepay</i> him, bit by bit, for the
      zinc-blocks: and <i>he</i> was willing to come to Oxford,
      and do it here. So it was all done in my studio, I
      remaining in waiting all the time, to turn over the
      pages.<br>
      <br>
      But I daresay I have told you so much of the story
      already.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. X&mdash; did a first-rate set of negatives, and took them
      away with him to get the zinc-blocks made. These he
      delivered pretty regularly at first, and there seemed to be
      every prospect of getting the book out by Christmas,
      1885.<br>
      <br>
      On October 18, 1885, I sent your book to Mrs. Liddell, who
      had told me your sisters were going to visit you and would
      take it with them. I trust it reached you safely?<br>
      <br>
      Soon after this&mdash;I having prepaid for the whole of the
      zinc-blocks&mdash;the supply suddenly ceased, while twenty-two
      pages were still due, and Mr. X&mdash; disappeared!<br>
      <br>
      My belief is that he was in hiding from his creditors. We
      sought him in vain. So things went on for months. At one
      time I thought of employing a detective to find him, but
      was assured that "all detectives are scoundrels." The
      alternative seemed to be to ask you to lend the book again,
      and get the missing pages re-photographed. But I was most
      unwilling to rob you of it again, and also afraid of the
      risk of loss of the book, if sent by post&mdash;for even
      "registered post" does not seem <i>absolutely</i> safe.<br>
      <br>
      In April he called at Macmillan's and left <i>eight</i>
      blocks, and again vanished into obscurity.<br>
      <br>
      This left us with fourteen pages (dotted up and down the
      book) still missing. I waited awhile longer, and then put
      the thing into the hands of a solicitor, who soon found the
      man, but could get nothing but promises from him. "You will
      never get the blocks," said the solicitor, "unless you
      frighten him by a summons before a magistrate." To this at
      last I unwillingly consented: the summons had to be taken
      out at &mdash; (that is where this aggravating man is living),
      and this entailed two journeys from Eastbourne&mdash;one to get
      the summons (my <i>personal</i> presence being necessary),
      and the other to attend in court with the solicitor on the
      day fixed for hearing the case. The defendant didn't
      appear; so the magistrate said he would take the case in
      his absence. Then I had the new and exciting experience of
      being put into the witness-box, and sworn, and
      cross-examined by a rather savage magistrate's clerk, who
      seemed to think that, if he only bullied me enough, he
      would soon catch me out in a falsehood! I had to give the
      magistrate a little lecture on photo-zincography, and the
      poor man declared the case was so complicated he must
      adjourn it for another week. But this time, in order to
      secure the presence of our slippery defendant, he issued a
      warrant for his apprehension, and the constable had orders
      to take him into custody and lodge him in prison, the night
      before the day when the case was to come on. The news of
      <i>this</i> effectually frightened him, and he delivered up
      the fourteen negatives (he hadn't done the blocks) before
      the fatal day arrived. I was rejoiced to get them, even
      though it entailed the paying a second time for getting the
      fourteen blocks done, and withdrew the action.<br>
      <br>
      The fourteen blocks were quickly done and put into the
      printer's hands; and all is going on smoothly at last: and
      I quite hope to have the book completed, and to be able to
      send you a very special copy (bound in white vellum, unless
      you would prefer some other style of binding) by the end of
      the month.<br>
      <br>
      Believe me always,<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely yours,<br>
      <br>

      "The Game of Logic" was Lewis Carroll's next book; it
      appeared about the end of February, 1887. As a method of
      teaching the first principles of Logic to children it has
      proved most useful; the subject, usually considered very
      difficult to a beginner, is made extremely easy by
      simplification of method, and both interesting and amusing
      by the quaint syllogisms that the author devised, such as&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      No bald person needs a hair-brush;<br>
      No lizards have hair;<br>
      Therefore[1] No lizard needs a hair brush.<br>
      <br>
      Caterpillars are not eloquent;<br>
      Jones is eloquent;<br>
      Jones is not a caterpillar.

    <p>
      Meanwhile, with much interchange of correspondence between
      author and artist, the pictures for the new fairy tale,
      "Sylvie and Bruno," were being gradually evolved. Each of
      them was subjected by Lewis Carroll to the most minute
      criticism&mdash;hyper-criticism, perhaps, occasionally. A few
      instances of the sort of criticisms he used to make upon
      Mr. Furniss's work may be interesting; I have extracted
      them from a letter dated September 1, 1887. It will be seen
      that when he really admired a sketch he did not stint his
      praise:&mdash;

      (1) "Sylvie helping beetle" [p. 193]. A quite charming
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      (3) "The Doctor" and "Eric." (Mr. Furniss's idea of their
      appearance). No! The Doctor won't do <i>at all!</i> He is a
      smug London man, a great "ladies' man," who would hardly
      talk anything but medical "shop." He is forty at least, and
      can have had no love-affair for the last fifteen years. I
      want him to be about twenty-five, powerful in frame,
      poetical in face: capable of intelligent interest in any
      subject, and of being a passionate lover. How would you
      draw King Arthur when he first met Guinevere? Try
      <i>that</i> type.<br>
      <br>
      Eric's attitude is capital: but his face is a little too
      near to the ordinary "masher." Please avoid <i>that</i>
      inane creature; and please don't cut his hair short. That
      fashion will be "out" directly.<br>
      <br>
      (4) "Lady Muriel" (head); ditto (full length); "Earl."<br>
      <br>
      I don't like <i>either</i> face of Lady Muriel. I don't
      think I could talk to her; and I'm quite sure I couldn't
      fall in love with her. Her dress ("evening," of course) is
      very pretty, I think.<br>
      <br>
      I don't like the Earl's face either. He is proud of his
      title, very formal, and one who would keep one "at arm's
      length" always. And he is too prodigiously tall. I want a
      gentle, genial old man; with whom one would feel at one's
      ease in a moment.<br>
      <br>
      (8) "Uggug becoming Porcupine" ("Sylvie and Bruno,
      Concluded," page 388), is exactly my conception of it. I
      expect this will be one of the most effective pictures in
      the book. The faces of the people should express intense
      <i>terror</i>.<br>
      <br>
      (9) "The Professor" is altogether <i>delightful</i>. When
      you get the text, you will see that you have hit the very
      centre of the bull's-eye.<br>
      <br>
      [A sketch of "Bruno"]. No, no! Please don't give us the (to
      my mind) very ugly, quite modern costume, which shows with
      such cruel distinctness a podgy, pot-bellied (excuse the
      vulgarism) boy, who couldn't run a mile to save his life. I
      want Bruno to be <i>strong</i>, but at the same time light
      and active&mdash;with the figure of one of the little acrobats
      one sees at the circus&mdash;not "Master Tommy," who habitually
      gorges himself with pudding. Also that dress I dislike very
      much. Please give him a short tunic, and <i>real</i>
      knickerbockers&mdash;not the tight knee-breeches they are rapidly
      shrinking to.<br>
      <br>
      Very truly yours,<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.

      By Mr. Furniss's kind permission I am enabled to give an
      example of the other side of the correspondence, one of his
      letters to Mr. Dodgson, all the more interesting for the
      charming little sketch which it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the spider, Mr. Dodgson had written: "Some
      writer says that the full face of a spider, as seen under a
      magnifying-glass, is very striking."

      An old bachelor is generally very precise and exact in his
      habits. He has no one but himself to look after, nothing to
      distract his attention from his own affairs; and Mr.
      Dodgson was the most precise and exact of old bachelors. He
      made a pr&#233;cis of every letter he wrote or received
      from the 1st of January, 1861, to the 8th of the same
      month, 1898. These pr&#233;cis were all numbered and
      entered in reference-books, and by an ingenious system of
      cross-numbering he was able to trace a whole
      correspondence, which might extend through several volumes.
      The last number entered in his book is 98,721.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scores of green cardboard boxes, all neatly
      labelled, in which he kept his various papers. These boxes
      formed quite a feature of his study at Oxford, a large
      number of them being arranged upon a revolving bookstand.
      The lists, of various sorts, which he kept were
      innumerable; one of them, that of unanswered
      correspondents, generally held seventy or eighty names at a
      time, exclusive of autograph-hunters, whom he did not
      answer on principle. He seemed to delight in being
      arithmetically accurate about every detail of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He always rose at the same early hour, and, if he was in
      residence at Christ Church, attended College Service. He
      spent the day according to a prescribed routine, which
      usually included a long walk into the country, very often
      alone, but sometimes with another Don, or perhaps, if the
      walk was not to be as long as usual, with some little
      girl-friend at his side. When he had a companion with him,
      he would talk the whole time, telling delightful stories,
      or explaining some new logical problem; if he was alone, he
      used to think out his books, as probably many another
      author has done and will do, in the course of a lonely
      walk. The only irregularity noticeable in his mode of life
      was the hour of retiring, which varied from 11 p.m. to four
      o'clock in the morning, according to the amount of work
      which he felt himself in the mood for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a wonderfully good memory, except for faces and
      dates. The former were always a stumbling-block to him, and
      people used to say (most unjustly) that he was
      intentionally short-sighted. One night he went up to London
      to dine with a friend, whom he had only recently met. The
      next morning a gentleman greeted him as he was walking. "I
      beg your pardon," said Mr. Dodgson, "but you have the
      advantage of me. I have no remembrance of having ever seen
      you before this moment." "That is very strange," the other
      replied, "for I was your host last night!" Such little
      incidents as this happened more than once. To help himself
      to remember dates, he devised a system of mnemonics, which
      he circulated among his friends. As it has never been
      published, and as some of my readers may find it useful, I
      reproduce it here.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My "Memoria Technica" is a modification of Gray's; but,
      whereas he used both consonants and vowels to represent
      digits, and had to content himself with a syllable of
      gibberish to represent the date or whatever other number
      was required, I use only consonants, and fill in with
      vowels <i>ad libitum,</i> and thus can always manage to
      make a real word of whatever has to be represented.<br>
      <br>
      The principles on which the necessary 20 consonants have
      been chosen are as follows:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        1. "b" and "c," the first two consonants in the
        alphabet.<br>
        <br>
        2. "d" from "duo," "w" from "two."<br>
        <br>
        3. "t" from "tres," the other may wait awhile.<br>
        <br>
        4. "f" from "four," "q" from "quattuor."<br>
        <br>
        5. "l" and "v," because "l" and "v" are the Roman symbols
        for "fifty" and "five."<br>
        <br>
        6. "s" and "x" from "six."<br>
        <br>
        7. "p" and "m" from "septem."<br>
        <br>
        8. "h" from "huit," and "k" from the Greek "okto."<br>
        <br>
        9. "n" from "nine"; and "g" because it is so like a
        "9."<br>
        <br>
        0. "z" and "r" from "zero."
      </blockquote><br>
      There is now one consonant still waiting for its digit,
      viz., "j," and one digit waiting for its consonant, viz.,
      "3," the conclusion is obvious.<br>
      <br>
      The result may be tabulated thus:&mdash;<br>

      When a word has been found, whose last consonants represent
      the number required, the best plan is to put it as the last
      word of a rhymed couplet, so that, whatever other words in
      it are forgotten, the rhyme will secure the only really
      important word.<br>
      <br>
      Now suppose you wish to remember the date of the discovery

      of America, which is 1492; the "1" may be left out as
      obvious; all we need is "492."<br>
      <br>
      Write it thus:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <pre>     <tt>
    4 9 2<br>
    f n d<br>
    q g w<br></tt>      <br></pre><br>
      <br>
      and try to find a word that contains "f" or "q," "n" or
      "g," "d" or "w." A word soon suggests itself&mdash;"found."<br>
      <br>
      The poetic faculty must now be brought into play, and the
      following couplet will soon be evolved:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        "Columbus sailed the world around,<br>
        Until America was F O U N D."
      </blockquote><br>
      <br>
      If possible, invent the couplets for yourself; you will
      remember them better than any others.<br>
      <br>
      <i>June</i>, 1888.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The inventor found this "Memoria Technica" very useful in
      helping him to remember the dates of the different
      Colleges. He often, of course, had to show his friends the
      sights of Oxford, and the easy way in which, asked or
      unasked, he could embellish his descriptions with dates
      used to surprise those who did not know how the thing was
      done. The couplet for St. John's College ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "They must have a bevel<br>
      To keep them so LEVEL."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The allusion is to the beautiful lawns, for which St.
      John's is famous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his power of remembering anecdotes, and bringing them
      out just at the right moment, Mr. Dodgson was unsurpassed.
      A guest brought into Christ Church Common Room was usually
      handed over to him to be amused. He was not a good man to
      tell a story to&mdash;he had always heard it before; but as a
      <i>raconteur</i> I never met his equal. And the best of it
      was that his stories never grew&mdash;except in number.
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have expected that a mind so clear and logical
      and definite would have fought shy of the feminine
      intellect, which is generally supposed to be deficient in
      those qualities; and so it is somewhat surprising to find
      that by far the greater number of his friends were ladies.
      He was quite prepared to correct them, however, when they
      were guilty of what seemed to him unreasoning conduct, as
      is shown by the following extract from a letter of his to a
      young lady who had asked him to try and find a place for a
      governess, without giving the latter's address:&mdash;
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      Some of my friends are business-men, and it is pleasant to
      see how methodical and careful they are in transacting any
      business-matter. If, for instance, one of them were to
      write to me, asking me to look out for a place for a French
      governess in whom he was interested, I should be sure to
      admire the care with which he would give me <i>her name in
      full</i>&mdash;(in extra-legible writing if it were an unusual
      name)&mdash;as well as her address. Some of my friends are not
      men of business.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So many such requests were addressed to him that at one
      time he had a circular letter printed, with a list of
      people requiring various appointments or assistants, which
      he sent round to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect Lewis Carroll resembled the stoic
      philosophers, for no outward circumstance could upset the
      tranquillity of his mind. He lived, in fact, the life which
      Marcus Aurelius commends so highly, the life of calm
      contentment, based on the assurance that so long as we are
      faithful to ourselves, no seeming evils can really harm us.
      But in him there was one exception to this rule. During an
      argument he was often excited. The war of words, the keen
      and subtle conflict between trained minds&mdash;in this his soul
      took delight, in this he sought and found the joy of battle
      and of victory. Yet he would not allow his serenity to be
      ruffled by any foe whom he considered unworthy of his
      steel; he refused to argue with people whom he knew to be
      hopelessly illogical&mdash;definitely refused, though with such
      tact that no wound was given, even to the most sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was modest in the true sense of the term, neither
      overestimating nor underrating his own mental powers, and
      preferring to follow his own course without regarding
      outside criticism. "I never read anything about myself or
      my books," he writes in a letter to a friend; and the
      reason he used to give was that if the critics praised him
      he might become conceited, while, if they found fault, he
      would only feel hurt and angry. On October 25, 1888, he
      wrote in his Diary: "I see there is a leader in to-day's
      <i>Standard</i> on myself as a writer; but I do not mean to
      read it. It is not healthy reading, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated publicity, and tried to avoid it in every way. "Do
      not tell any one, if you see me in the theatre," he wrote
      once to Miss Marion Terry. On another occasion, when he was
      dining out at Oxford, and some one, who did not know that
      it was a forbidden subject, turned the conversation on
      "Alice in Wonderland," he rose suddenly and fled from the
      house. I could multiply instances of this sort, but it
      would be unjust to his memory to insist upon the morbid way
      in which he regarded personal popularity. As compared with
      self-advertisement, it is certainly the lesser evil; but
      that it <i>is</i> an evil, and a very painful one to its
      possessor, Mr. Dodgson fully saw. Of course it had its
      humorous side, as, for instance, when he was brought into
      contact with lion-hunters, autograph-collectors, <i>et hoc
      genus omne</i>. He was very suspicious of unknown
      correspondents who addressed questions to him; in later
      years he either did not answer them at all, or used a
      typewriter. Before he bought his typewriter, he would get
      some friend to write for him, and even to sign "Lewis
      Carroll" at the end of the letter. It used to give him
      great amusement to picture the astonishment of the
      recipients of these letters, if by any chance they ever
      came to compare his "autographs."

      On one occasion the secretary of a "Young Ladies' Academy"
      in the United States asked him to present some of his works
      to the School Library. The envelope was addressed to "Lewis
      Carroll, Christ Church," an incongruity which always
      annoyed him intensely. He replied to the Secretary, "As Mr.
      Dodgson's books are all on Mathematical subjects, he fears
      that they would not be very acceptable in a school
      library."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some fourteen or fifteen years ago, the Fourth-class of the
      Girl's Latin School at Boston, U.S., started a magazine,
      and asked him if they might call it <i>The Jabberwock.</i>
      He wrote in reply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Mr. Lewis Carroll has much pleasure in giving to the
      editors of the proposed magazine permission to use the
      title they wish for. He finds that the Anglo-Saxon word
      "wocer" or "wocor" signifies "offspring" or "fruit." Taking
      "jabber" in its ordinary acceptation of "excited and
      voluble discussion," this would give the meaning of "the
      result of much excited discussion." Whether this phrase
      will have any application to the projected periodical, it
      will be for the future historian of American literature to
      determine. Mr. Carroll wishes all success to the
      forthcoming magazine.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From that time forward he took a great interest in the
      magazine, and thought very well of it. It used, I believe,
      to be regularly supplied to him. Only once did he express
      disapproval of anything it contained, and that was in 1888,
      when he felt it necessary to administer a rebuke for what
      he thought to be an irreverent joke. The sequel is given in
      the following extract from <i>The Jabberwock</i> for June,
      1888:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Jabberwock</i> has many friends, and perhaps a few
      (very few, let us hope) enemies. But, of the former, the
      friend who has helped us most on the road to success is Mr.
      Lewis Carroll, the author of "Alice in Wonderland," &amp;c.
      Our readers will remember his kind letter granting us
      permission to use the name "Jabberwock," and also giving
      the meaning of that word. Since then we have received
      another letter from him, in which he expresses both
      surprise and regret at an anecdote which we published in an
      early number of our little paper. We would assure Mr.
      Carroll, as well as our other friends, that we had no
      intention of making light of a serious matter, but merely
      quoted the anecdote to show what sort of a book
      Washington's diary was.<br>
      <br>
      But now a third letter from our kind friend has come,
      enclosing, to our delight, a poem, "A Lesson in Latin," the
      pleasantest Latin lesson we have had this year.<br>
      <br>
      The first two letters from Mr. Carroll were in a beautiful
      literary hand, whereas the third is written with a
      typewriter. It is to this fact that he refers in his
      letter, which is as follows:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        "29, Bedford Street,<br>
        Covent Garden, LONDON,<br>
        <br>
        <i>May</i> 16, 1888.<br>
        <br>
        Dear Young Friends,&mdash;After the Black Draught of serious
        remonstrance which I ventured to send to you the other
        day, surely a Lump of Sugar will not be unacceptable? The
        enclosed I wrote this afternoon on purpose for you.<br>
        <br>
        I hope you will grant it admission to the columns of
        <i>The Jabberwock</i>, and not scorn it as a mere play
        upon words.<br>
        <br>
        This mode of writing, is, of course, an American
        invention. We never invent new machinery here; we do but
        use, to the best of our ability, the machines you send
        us. For the one I am now using, I beg you to accept my
        best thanks, and to believe me<br>
        <br>
        Your sincere friend,<br>
        <br>
        Lewis Carroll."
      </blockquote><br>
      <br>
      Surely we can patiently swallow many Black Draughts, if we
      are to be rewarded with so sweet a Lump of Sugar!<br>
      <br>
      The enclosed poem, which has since been republished in
      "Three Sunsets," runs as follows:<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        A LESSON IN LATIN.<br>
        <br>
        Our Latin books, in motley row,<br>
        Invite us to the task&mdash;<br>

        No higher skill we ask:<br>

        We've learned "amare" means "to love"!<br>
        <br>
        So hour by hour, from flower to flower,<br>
        We sip the sweets of life:<br>
        Till ah! too soon the clouds arise,<br>
        And knitted brows and angry eyes<br>
        Proclaim the dawn of strife.<br>
        With half a smile and half a sigh,<br>
        "Amare! Bitter One!" we cry.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,<br>
        "Too well the scholar knows<br>
        There is no rose without a thorn "&mdash;<br>
        But peace is made! we sing, this morn,<br>
        "No thorn without a rose!"<br>

      In October Mr. Dodgson invented a very ingenious little
      stamp-case, decorated with two "Pictorial Surprises,"
      representing the "Cheshire Cat" vanishing till nothing but
      the grin was left, and the baby turning into a pig in
      "Alice's" arms. The invention was entered at Stationers'
      Hall, and published by Messrs. Emberlin and Son, of Oxford.
      As an appropriate accompaniment, he wrote "Eight or Nine
      Wise Words on Letter-Writing," a little booklet which is
      still sold along with the case. The "Wise Words," as the
      following extracts show, have the true "Carrollian" ring
      about them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Some American writer has said "the snakes in this district
      may be divided into one species&mdash;the venomous." The same
      principle applies here. Postage-stamp-cases may be divided
      into one species&mdash;the "Wonderland."<br>
      <br>
      Since I have possessed a "Wonderland-Stamp-Case," Life has
      been bright and peaceful, and I have used no other. I
      believe the Queen's Laundress uses no other.<br>
      <br>
      My fifth Rule is, if your friend makes a severe remark,
      either leave it unnoticed or make your reply distinctly
      less severe: and, if he makes a friendly remark, tending
      towards "making up" the little difference that has arisen
      between you, let your reply be distinctly <i>more</i>
      friendly. If, in picking a quarrel, each party declined to
      go more than <i>three-eighths</i> of the way, and if, in
      making friends, each was ready to go <i>five-eighths</i> of
      the way&mdash;why, there would be more reconciliations than
      quarrels! Which is like the Irishman's remonstrance to his
      gad-about daughter: "Shure, you're <i>always</i> goin' out!
      You go out <i>three</i> times for wanst that you come
      in!"<br>
      <br>
      My sixth Rule is, <i>don't try to have the last word!</i>
      How many a controversy would be nipped in the bud, if each
      was anxious to let the <i>other</i> have the last word!
      Never mind how telling a rejoinder you leave unuttered:
      never mind your friend's supposing that you are silent from
      lack of anything to say: let the thing drop, as soon as it
      is possible without discourtesy: remember "Speech is
      silvern, but silence is golden"! (N.B. If you are a
      gentleman, and your friend a lady, this Rule is
      superfluous: <i>you won't get the last word!</i>)<br>
      <br>
      Remember the old proverb, "Cross-writing makes
      cross-reading." "The <i>old</i> proverb?" you say
      inquiringly. "<i>How</i> old?" Well, not so <i>very</i>
      ancient, I must confess. In fact, I invented it while
      writing this paragraph. Still, you know, "old" is a
      <i>comparative</i> term. I think you would be <i>quite</i>
      justified in addressing a chicken, just out of the shell,
      as "old boy!" <i>when compared</i> with another chicken
      that was only half-out!

      The pamphlet ends with an explanation of Lewis Carroll's
      method of using a correspondence-book, illustrated by a few
      imaginary pages from such a compilation, which are very
      humorous.

      At the end of the year the "Alice" operetta was again
      produced at the Globe Theatre, with Miss Isa Bowman as the
      heroine. "Isa makes a delightful Alice," Mr. Dodgson
      writes, "and Emsie [a younger sister] is wonderfully good

      sings a verse, and dances the Sailor's Hornpipe."

      The first of an incomplete series, "Curiosa Mathematica,"
      was published for Mr. Dodgson by Messrs. Macmillan during
      the year. It was entitled "A New Theory of Parallels," and
      any one taking it up for the first time might be tempted to
      ask, Is the author serious, or is he simply giving us some
      <i>jeu d'esprit?</i> A closer inspection, however, soon
      settles the question, and the reader, if mathematics be his
      hobby, is carried irresistibly along till he reaches the
      last page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object which Mr. Dodgson set himself to accomplish was
      to prove Euclid I. 32 without assuming the celebrated 12th
      Axiom, a feat which calls up visions of the
      "Circle-Squarers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The work is divided into two parts: Book I. contains
      certain Propositions which require no disputable Axiom for
      their proof, and when once the few Definitions of "amount,"
      &amp;c., have become familiar it is easy reading. In Book
      II. the author introduces a new Axiom, or rather
      "Quasi-Axiom"&mdash;for it's <i>self-evident</i> character is
      open to dispute. This Axiom is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In any Circle the inscribed equilateral Tetragon (Hexagon
      in editions 1st and 2nd) is greater than any one of the
      Segments which lie outside it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Assuming the truth of this Axiom, Mr. Dodgson proves a
      series of Propositions, which lead up to and enable him to
      accomplish the feat referred to above.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of Book II. he places a proof (so far as finite
      magnitudes are concerned) of Euclid's Axiom, preceded by
      and dependent on the Axiom that "If two homogeneous
      magnitudes be both of them finite, the lesser may be so
      multiplied by a finite number as to exceed the greater."
      This Axiom, he says, he believes to be assumed by every
      writer who has attempted to prove Euclid's 12th Axiom. The
      proof itself is borrowed, with slight alterations, from
      Cuthbertson's "Euclidean Geometry."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Appendix I. there is an alternative Axiom which may be
      substituted for that which introduces Book II., and which
      will probably commend itself to many minds as being more
      truly axiomatic. To substitute this, however, involves some
      additions and alterations, which the author appends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appendix II. is headed by the somewhat startling question,
      "Is Euclid's Axiom true?" and though true for finite
      magnitudes&mdash;the sense in which, no doubt, Euclid meant it to
      be taken&mdash;it is shown to be not universally true. In
      Appendix III. he propounds the question, "How should
      Parallels be defined?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Appendix IV., which deals with the theory of Parallels as
      it stands to-day, concludes with the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am inclined to believe that if ever Euclid I. 32 is
      proved without a new Axiom, it will be by some new and
      ampler definition of the <i>Right Line</i>&mdash;some definition
      which shall connote that mysterious property, which it must
      somehow possess, which causes Euclid I. 32 to be true. Try
      <i>that</i> track, my gentle reader! It is not much trodden
      as yet. And may success attend your search!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the Introduction, which, as is frequently the case,
      ought to be read <i>last</i> in order to be appreciated
      properly, he relates his experiences with two of those
      "misguided visionaries," the circle-squarers. One of them
      had selected 3.2 as the value for "<i>pi</i>," and the
      other proved, to his own satisfaction at least, that it is
      correctly represented by 3! The Rev. Watson Hagger, to
      whose kindness, as I have already stated in my Preface, my
      readers are indebted for the several accounts of Mr.
      Dodgson's books on mathematics which appear in this Memoir,
      had a similar experience with one of these "cranks." This
      circle-squarer selected 3.125 as the value for "<i>pi</i>,"
      and Mr. Hagger, who was fired with Mr. Dodgson's ambition
      to convince his correspondent of his error, failed as
      signally as Mr. Dodgson did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter is interesting as showing that, strict
      Conservative though he was, he was not in religious matters
      narrow-minded; he held his own opinions strongly, but he
      would never condemn those of other people. He saw "good in
      everything," and there was but little exaggeration, be it
      said in all reverence, in the phrase which an old friend of
      his used in speaking of him to me: "Mr. Dodgson was as
      broad&mdash;as broad as <i>Christ</i>."

      might prefer that I should send it to your little sister
      (?) (niece) Rachel, whom you mentioned in one of your
      letters. It is to be called "The Nursery Alice," and is
      meant for very young children, consisting of coloured
      enlargements of twenty of the pictures in "Alice," with
      explanations such as one would give in showing them to a
      little child.<br>
      <br>

      broad enough to include <i>Christians</i> of all
      denominations; in fact, I have one valued friend (a lady

      Towards the end of the year Lewis Carroll had tremendously
      hard work, completing "Sylvie and Bruno." For several days
      on end he worked from breakfast until nearly ten in the
      evening without a rest. At last it was off his hands, and
      for a month or so he was (comparatively) an idle man. Some
      notes from his Diary, written during this period, follow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Nov. 17th.</i>&mdash;Met, for first time, an actual believer
      in the "craze" that buying and selling are wrong (!) (he is
      rather 'out of his mind'). The most curious thing was his
      declaration that he himself <i>lives</i> on that theory,
      and never buys anything, and has no money! I thought of
      railway travelling, and ventured to ask how he got from
      London to Oxford? "On a bicycle!" And how he got the
      bicycle? "It was given him!" So I was floored, and there
      was no time to think of any other instances. The whole
      thing was so new to me that, when he declared it to be
      <i>un-Christian</i>, I quite forgot the text, "He that hath
      no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Dec. 19th.</i>&mdash;Went over to Birmingham to see a
      performance of "Alice" (Mrs. Freiligrath Kroeker's version)
      at the High School. I rashly offered to tell "Bruno's
      Picnic" afterwards to the little children, thinking I
      should have an audience of 40 or 50, mostly children,
      instead of which I had to tell it from the stage to an
      audience of about 280, mostly older girls and grown-up
      people! However, I got some of the children to come on the
      stage with me, and the little Alice (Muriel Howard-Smith,
      &#230;t. 11) stood by me, which made it less awful. The
      evening began with some of "Julius Caesar" in German. This
      and "Alice" were really capitally acted, the White Queen
      being quite the best I have seen (Miss B. Lloyd Owen). I
      was introduced to Alice and a few more, and was quite sorry
      to hear afterwards that the other performers wanted to
      shake hands.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The publication of "Sylvie and Bruno" marks an epoch in its
      author's life, for it was the publication of all the ideals
      and sentiments which he held most dear. It was a book with
      a definite purpose; it would be more true to say with
      several definite purposes. For this very reason it is not
      an artistic triumph as the two "Alice" books undoubtedly
      are; it is on a lower literary level, there is no unity in
      the story. But from a higher standpoint, that of the
      Christian and the philanthropist, the book is the best
      thing he ever wrote. It is a noble effort to uphold the
      right, or what he thought to be the right, without fear of
      contempt or unpopularity. The influence which his earlier
      books had given him he was determined to use in asserting
      neglected truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the story has other features, delightful nonsense
      not surpassed by anything in "Wonderland," childish prattle
      with all the charm of reality about it, and pictures which
      may fairly be said to rival those of Sir John Tenniel. Had
      these been all, the book would have been a great success.
      As things are, there are probably hundreds of readers who
      have been scared by the religious arguments and political
      discussions which make up a large part of it, and who have
      never discovered that Sylvie is just as entrancing a
      personage as Alice when you get to know her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the sentiment of the following poem, sent to Lewis
      Carroll by an anonymous correspondent, may also explain why
      some of "Alice's" lovers have given "Sylvie" a less warm
      welcome:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      TO SYLVIE.<br>
      <br>
      Ah! Sylvie, winsome, wise and good!<br>
      Fain would I love thee as I should.<br>
      But, to tell the truth, my dear,&mdash;<br>
      And Sylvie loves the truth to hear,&mdash;<br>
      Though fair and pure and sweet thou art,<br>
      Thine elder sister has my heart!<br>
      I gave it her long, long ago<br>
      To have and hold; and well I know,<br>
      Brave Lady Sylvie, thou wouldst scorn<br>
      To accept a heart foresworn.<br>
      <br>
      Lovers thou wilt have enow<br>
      Under many a greening bough&mdash;<br>
      Lovers yet unborn galore,<br>
      Like Alice all the wide world o'er;<br>
      But, darling, I am now too old<br>
      To change. And though I still shall hold<br>
      Thee, and that puckling sprite, thy brother,<br>
      Dear, I cannot <i>love</i> another:<br>
      In this heart of mine I own<br>
      <i>She</i> must ever reign alone!<br>
      <br>
      <i>March</i>, 1890.<br>
      <br>

      I do not know N.P.'s name and address, or I should have
      asked leave before giving publicity to the above verses. If
      these words meet his eye, I hope he will accept my most
      humble apologies for the liberty I have taken.

    <p>
      At the beginning of 1894 a Baptist minister, preaching on
      the text, "No man liveth to himself," made use of "Sylvie
      and Bruno" to enforce his argument. After saying that he
      had been reading that book, he proceeded as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A child was asked to define charity. He said it was "givin'
      away what yer didn't want yerself." This was some people's
      idea of self-sacrifice; but it was not Christ's. Then as to
      serving others in view of reward: Mr. Lewis Carroll put
      this view of the subject very forcibly in his "Sylvie and
      Bruno"&mdash;an excellent book for youth; indeed, for men and
      women too. He first criticised Archdeacon Paley's
      definition of virtue (which was said to be "the doing good
      to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the
      sake of everlasting happiness,") and then turned to such
      hymns as the following:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      <blockquote>
        Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,<br>
        <i>Repaid a thousandfold shall be</i>,<br>
        Then gladly will we give to Thee,<br>
        Giver of all!
      </blockquote>Mr. Carroll's comment was brief and to the
      point. He said: "Talk of Original <i>Sin</i>! Can you have
      a stronger proof of the Original Goodness there must be in
      this nation than the fact that Religion has been preached
      to us, as a commercial speculation, for a century, and that
      we still believe in a God?" ["Sylvie and Bruno," Part i.,
      pp. 276, 277.] Of course it was quite true, as Mr. Carroll
      pointed out, that our good deeds would be rewarded; but we
      ought to do them because they were <i>good</i>, and not
      because the reward was great.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the Preface to "Sylvie and Bruno," Lewis Carroll alluded
      to certain editions of Shakespeare which seemed to him
      unsuitable for children; it never seemed to strike him that
      his words might be read by children, and that thus his
      object very probably would be defeated, until this fact was
      pointed out to him in a letter from an unknown
      correspondent, Mr. J.C. Cropper, of Hampstead. Mr. Dodgson
      replied as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Accept my best thanks for your thoughtful and
      valuable suggestion about the Preface to "Sylvie and
      Bruno." The danger you point out had not occurred to me (I
      suppose I had not thought of <i>children</i> reading the
      Preface): but it is a very real one, and I am very glad to
      have had my attention called to it.<br>
      <br>
      Believe me, truly yours,<br>
      <br>
      Lewis Carroll.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mathematical controversy carried on by correspondence was a
      favourite recreation of Mr. Dodgson's, and on February 20,
      1890, he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I've just concluded a correspondence with a Cambridge man,
      who is writing a Geometry on the "Direction" theory
      (Wilson's plan), and thinks he has avoided Wilson's (what
      <i>I</i> think) fallacies. He <i>hasn't</i>, but I can't
      convince him! My view of life is, that it's next to
      impossible to convince <i>anybody</i> of <i>anything</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following letter is very characteristic. "Whatsoever
      thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might," was Mr.
      Dodgson's rule of life, and, as the end drew near, he only
      worked the harder:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Christ Church, Oxford, <i>April</i> 10, 1890.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Atkinson,&mdash;Many and sincere thanks for your most
      hospitable invitation, and for the very interesting photo
      of the family group. The former I fear I must ask you to
      let me defer <i>sine die</i>, and regard it as a pleasant
      dream, not <i>quite</i> hopeless of being some day
      realised. I keep a list of such pleasant possibilities, and
      yours is now one of ten similar kind offers of hospitality.
      But as life shortens in, and the evening shadows loom in
      sight, one gets to <i>grudge any</i> time given to mere
      pleasure, which might entail the leaving work half finished
      that one is longing to do before the end comes.<br>
      <br>
      There are several books I <i>greatly</i> desire to get
      finished for children. I am glad to find my working powers
      are as good as they ever were. Even with the mathematical
      book (a third edition) which I am now getting through the
      press, I think nothing of working six hours at a
      stretch.<br>
      <br>
      There is one text that often occurs to me, "The night
      cometh, when no man can work." Kindest regards to Mrs.
      Atkinson, and love to Gertrude.<br>
      <br>
      Always sincerely yours,<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.

    <p>
      For the benefit of children aged "from nought to five," as
      he himself phrased it, Lewis Carroll prepared a nursery
      edition of "Alice." He shortened the text considerably, and
      altered it so much that only the plot of the story remained
      unchanged. It was illustrated by the old pictures, coloured
      by Tenniel, and the cover was adorned by a picture designed
      by Miss E. Gertrude Thomson. As usual, the Dedication takes
      the form of an anagram, the solution of which is the name
      of one of his later child-friends. "<i>The Nursery
      'Alice,</i>'" was published by Macmillan and Co., in March,
      1890.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 18th the following letter on the "Eight Hours
      Movement" appeared in <i>The Standard:</i>&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Sir,&mdash;Supposing it were the custom, in a certain town, to
      sell eggs in paper bags at so much per bag, and that a
      fierce dispute had arisen between the egg vendors and the
      public as to how many eggs each bag should be understood to
      contain, the vendors wishing to be allowed to make up
      smaller bags; and supposing the public were to say, "In
      future we will pay you so much per egg, and you can make up
      bags as you please," would any ground remain for further
      dispute?<br>
      <br>
      Supposing that employers of labour, when threatened with a
      "strike" in case they should decline to reduce the number
      of hours in a working day, were to reply, "In future we
      will pay you so much per hour, and you can make up days as
      you please," it does appear to me&mdash;being, as I confess, an
      ignorant outsider&mdash;that the dispute would die out for want
      of a <i>raison d'&#234;tre</i>, and that these disastrous
      strikes, inflicting such heavy loss on employers and
      employed alike, would become things of the past.<br>
      <br>
      I am, Sir, your obedient servant,<br>
      <br>
      Lewis Carroll.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The remainder of the year was uneventful; a few notes from
      his Diary must represent it here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Oct. 4th.</i>&mdash;Called on Mr. Coventry Patmore (at
      Hastings), and was very kindly received by him, and stayed
      for afternoon tea and dinner. He showed me some interesting
      pictures, including a charming little drawing, by Holman
      Hunt, of one of his daughters when three years old. He gave
      me an interesting account of his going, by Tennyson's
      request, to his lodging to look for the MS. of "In
      Memoriam," which he had left behind, and only finding it by
      insisting on going upstairs, in spite of the landlady's
      opposition, to search for it. Also he told me the story (I
      think I have heard it before) of what Wordsworth told his
      friends as the "one joke" of his life, in answer to a
      passing carter who asked if he had seen his wife. "My good
      friend, I didn't even know you had a wife!" He seems a very
      hale and vigorous old man for nearly seventy, which I think
      he gave as his age in writing to me.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Oct. 31st.</i>&mdash;This morning, thinking over the problem
      of finding two squares whose sum is a square, I chanced on
      a theorem (which seems <i>true</i>, though I cannot prove
      it), that if x&#178; + y&#178; be even, its half is the sum
      of two squares. A kindred theorem, that 2(x&#178; +
      y&#178;) is always the sum of two squares, also seems true
      and unprovable.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Nov. 5th.&mdash;</i>I have now proved the above two theorems.
      Another pretty deduction from the theory of square numbers
      is, that any number whose square is the sum of two squares,
      is itself the sum of two squares.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have already mentioned Mr. Dodgson's habit of thinking
      out problems at night. Often new ideas would occur to him
      during hours of sleeplessness, and he had long wanted to
      hear of or invent some easy method of taking notes in the
      dark. At first he tried writing within oblongs cut out of
      cardboard, but the result was apt to be illegible. In 1891
      he conceived the device of having a series of squares cut
      out in card, and inventing an alphabet, of which each
      letter was made of lines, which could be written along the
      edges of the squares, and dots, which could be marked at
      the corners. The thing worked well, and he named it the
      "Typhlograph," but, at the suggestion of one of his
      brother-students, this was subsequently changed into
      "Nyctograph."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne, attending service
      every Sunday at Christ Church, according to his usual rule.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Sept.</i> 6, 1891.&mdash;At the evening service at Christ
      Church a curious thing happened, suggestive of telepathy.
      Before giving out the second hymn the curate read out some
      notices. Meanwhile I took my hymn-book, and said to myself
      (I have no idea <i>why</i>), "It will be hymn 416," and I
      turned to it. It was not one I recognised as having ever
      heard; and, on looking at it, I said, "It is very prosaic;
      it is a very unlikely one"&mdash;and it was really startling,
      the next minute, to hear the curate announce "Hymn 416."

      In October it became generally known that Dean Liddell was
      going to resign at Christmas. This was a great blow to Mr.
      Dodgson, but little mitigated by the fact that the very man
      whom he himself would have chosen, Dr. Paget, was appointed
      to fill the vacant place. The old Dean was very popular in
      College; even the undergraduates, with whom he was seldom
      brought into contact, felt the magic of his commanding
      personality and the charm of his gracious, old-world
      manner. He was a man whom, once seen, it was almost
      impossible to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly before the resignation of Dr. Liddell, the Duchess
      of Albany spent a few days at the Deanery. Mr. Dodgson was
      asked to meet her Royal Highness at luncheon, but was
      unable to go. Princess Alice and the little Duke of Albany,
      however, paid him a visit, and were initiated in the art of
      making paper pistols. He promised to send the Princess a
      copy of a book called "The Fairies," and the children,
      having spent a happy half-hour in his rooms, returned to
      the Deanery. This was one of the days which he "marked with
      a white stone." He sent a copy of "The Nursery 'Alice'" to
      the little Princess Alice, and received a note of thanks
      from her, and also a letter from her mother, in which she
      said that the book had taught the Princess to like reading,
      and to do it out of lesson-time. To the Duke he gave a copy
      of a book entitled "The Merry Elves." In his little note of
      thanks for this gift, the boy said, "Alice and I want you
      to love us both." Mr. Dodgson sent Princess Alice a puzzle,
      promising that if she found it out, he would give her a
      "golden chair from Wonderland."

      At the close of the year he wrote me a long letter, which I
      think worthy of reproducing here, for he spent a long time
      over it, and it contains excellent examples of his clear
      way of putting things.

      <i>To S.D. Collingwood.</i><br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., Oxford, <i>Dec</i>. 29, 1891.<br>
      <br>
      My Dear Stuart,&mdash;(Rather a large note&mdash;sheet, isn't it? But
      they do differ in size, you know.) I fancy this book of
      science (which I have had a good while, without making any
      use of it), may prove of some use to you, with your boys.
      [I was a schoolmaster at that time.] Also this cycling-book
      (or whatever it is to be called) may be useful in putting
      down engagements, &amp;c., besides telling you a lot about
      cycles. There was no use in sending it to <i>me; my</i>
      cycling days are over.<br>
      <br>
      You ask me if your last piece of "Meritt" printing is dark
      enough. I think not. I should say the rollers want fresh
      inking. As to the <i>matter</i> of your specimen&mdash;[it was a
      poor little essay on killing animals for the purpose of
      scientific recreations, <i>e.g</i>., collecting
      butterflies]&mdash;I think you <i>cannot</i> spend your time
      better than in trying to set down clearly, in that
      essay-form, your ideas on any subject that chances to
      interest you; and <i>specially</i> any theological subject
      that strikes you in the course of your reading for Holy
      Orders.<br>
      <br>
      It will be most <i>excellent</i> practice for you, against
      the time when you try to compose sermons, to try thus to
      realise exactly what it is you mean, and to express it
      clearly, and (a much harder matter) to get into proper
      shape the <i>reasons</i> of your opinions, and to see
      whether they do, or do not, tend to prove the conclusions
      you come to. You have never studied technical Logic, at
      all, I fancy. [I <i>had</i>, but I freely admit that the
      essay in question proved that I had not then learnt to
      apply my principles to practice.] It would have been a
      great help: but still it is not indispensable: after all,
      it is only the putting into rules of the way in which
      <i>every</i> mind proceeds, when it draws valid
      conclusions; and, by practice in careful thinking, you may
      get to know "fallacies" when you meet with them, without
      knowing the formal <i>rules</i>.<br>
      <br>
      At present, when you try to give <i>reasons</i>, you are in
      considerable danger of propounding fallacies. Instances
      occur in this little essay of yours; and I hope it won't
      offend your <i>amour propre</i> very much, if an old uncle,
      who has studied Logic for forty years, makes a few remarks
      on it.<br>
      <br>
      I am not going to enter <i>at all</i> on the subject-matter
      itself, or to say whether I agree, or not, with your
      <i>conclusions</i> : but merely to examine, from a
      logic-lecturer's point of view, your <i>premisses</i> as
      relating to them.<br>
      <br>
      (1) "As the lower animals do not appear to have personality
      or individual existence, I cannot see that any particular
      one's life can be very important," &amp;c. The word
      "personality" is very vague: I don't know what you mean by
      it. If you were to ask yourself, "What test should I use in
      distinguishing what <i>has</i>, from what has <i>not</i>,
      personality?" you might perhaps be able to express your
      meaning more clearly. The phrase "individual existence" is
      clear enough, and is in direct logical contradiction to the
      phrase "particular one." To say, of anything, that it has
      <i>not</i> "individual existence," and yet that it
      <i>is</i> a "particular one," involves the logical fallacy
      called a "contradiction in terms."<br>
      <br>
      (2) "In both cases" (animal and plant) "death is only the
      conversion of matter from one form to another." The word
      "form" is very vague&mdash;I fancy you use it in a sort of
      <i>chemical</i> sense (like saying "sugar is starch in
      another form," where the change in nature is generally
      believed to be a rearrangement of the very same atoms). If
      you mean to assert that the difference between a live
      animal and a dead animal, <i>i.e.,</i> between animate and
      sensitive matter, and the same matter when it becomes
      inanimate and insensitive, is a mere rearrangement of the
      same atoms, your premiss is intelligible. (It is a bolder
      one than any biologists have yet advanced. The most
      sceptical of them admits, I believe, that "vitality" is a
      thing <i>per se.</i> However, that is beside my present
      scope.) But this premiss is advanced to prove that it is of
      no "consequence" to kill an animal. But, granting that the
      conversion of sensitive into insensitive matter (and of
      course <i>vice versa</i>) is a mere change of "form," and
      <i>therefore</i> of no "consequence"; granting this, we
      cannot escape the including under this rule all similar
      cases. If the <i>power</i> of feeling pain, and the
      <i>absence</i> of that power, are only a difference of
      "form," the conclusion is inevitable that the
      <i>feeling</i> pain, and the <i>not</i> feeling it, are
      <i>also</i> only a difference in form, <i>i.e.,</i> to
      convert matter, which is <i>not</i> feeling pain, into
      matter <i>feeling</i> pain, is only to change its "form,"
      and, if the process of "changing form" is of no
      "consequence" in the case of sensitive and insensitive
      matter, we must admit that it is <i>also</i> of no
      "consequence" in the case of pain-feeling and <i>not</i>
      pain-feeling matter. This conclusion, I imagine, you
      neither intended nor foresaw. The premiss, which you use,
      involves the fallacy called "proving too much."<br>
      <br>
      The best advice that could be given to you, when you begin
      to compose sermons, would be what an old friend once gave
      to a young man who was going out to be an Indian judge (in
      India, it seems, the judge decides things, without a jury,
      like our County Court judges). "Give <i>your decisions</i>
      boldly and clearly; they will probably be <i>right</i>. But
      do <i>not</i> give your <i>reasons: they</i> will probably
      be <i>wrong"</i> If your lot in life is to be in a
      <i>country</i> parish, it will perhaps not matter
      <i>much</i> whether the reasons given in your sermons do or
      do not prove your conclusions. But even there you
      <i>might</i> meet, and in a town congregation you would be
      <i>sure</i> to meet, clever sceptics, who know well how to
      argue, who will detect your fallacies and point them out to
      those who are <i>not</i> yet troubled with doubts, and thus
      undermine <i>all</i> their confidence in your teaching.<br>
      <br>
      At Eastbourne, last summer, I heard a preacher advance the
      astounding argument, "We believe that the Bible is true,
      because our holy Mother, the Church, tells us it is." I
      pity that unfortunate clergyman if ever he is bold enough
      to enter any Young Men's Debating Club where there is some
      clear-headed sceptic who has heard, or heard of, that
      sermon. I can fancy how the young man would rub his hands,
      in delight, and would say to himself, "Just see me get him
      into a corner, and convict him of arguing in a circle!"<br>
      <br>
      The bad logic that occurs in many and many a well-meant
      sermon, is a real danger to modern Christianity. When
      detected, it may seriously injure many believers, and fill
      them with miserable doubts. So my advice to you, as a young
      theological student, is "Sift your reasons <i>well</i> ,
      and, before you offer them to others, make sure that they
      prove your conclusions."<br>
      <br>
      I hope you won't give this letter of mine (which it has
      cost me some time and thought to write) just a single
      reading and then burn it; but that you will lay it aside.
      Perhaps, even years hence, it may be of some use to you to
      read it again.<br>

    <p>
      At Christ Church, as at other Colleges, the Common Room is
      an important feature. Open from eight in the morning until
      ten at night, it takes the place of a club, where the
      "dons" may see the newspapers, talk, write letters, or
      enjoy a cup of tea. After dinner, members of High Table,
      with their guests if any are present, usually adjourn to
      the Common Room for wine and dessert, while there is a
      smoking-room hard by for those who do not despise the
      harmless but unnecessary weed, and below are cellars, with
      a goodly store of choice old wines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Curator's duties were therefore sufficiently onerous.
      They were doubly so in Mr. Dodgson's case, for his love of
      minute accuracy greatly increased the amount of work he had
      to do. It was his office to select and purchase wines, to
      keep accounts, to adjust selling price to cost price, to
      see that the two Common Room servants performed their
      duties, and generally to look after the comfort and
      convenience of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Having heard," he wrote near the end of the year 1892,
      "that Strong was willing to be elected (as Curator), and
      Common Room willing to elect him, I most gladly resigned.
      The sense of relief at being free from the burdensome
      office, which has cost me a large amount of time and
      trouble, is very delightful. I was made Curator, December
      8, 1882, so that I have held the office more than nine
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The literary results of his Curatorship were three very
      interesting little pamphlets, "Twelve Months in a
      Curatorship, by One who has tried it"; "Three years in a
      Curatorship, by One whom it has tried"; and "Curiosissima
      Curatoria, by 'Rude Donatus,'" all printed for private
      circulation, and couched in the same serio-comic vein. As a
      logician he naturally liked to see his thoughts in print,
      for, just as the mathematical mind craves for a black-board
      and a piece of chalk, so the logical mind must have its
      paper and printing-press wherewith to set forth its
      deductions effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few extracts must suffice to show the style of these
      pamphlets, and the opportunity offered for the display of
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the arrangement of the prices at which wines were to be
      sold to members of Common Room, he found a fine scope for
      the exercise of his mathematical talents and his sense of
      proportion. In one of the pamphlets he takes old Port and
      Chablis as illustrations.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The original cost of each is about 3s. a bottle; but the
      present value of the old Port is about 11s. a bottle. Let
      us suppose, then, that we have to sell to Common Room one
      bottle of old Port and three of Chablis, the original cost
      of the whole being 12s., and the present value 20s. These
      are our data. We have now two questions to answer. First,
      what sum shall we ask for the whole? Secondly, how shall we
      apportion that sum between the two kinds of wine?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The sum to be asked for the whole he decides, following
      precedent, is to be the present market-value of the wine;
      as to the second question, he goes on to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We have, as so often happens in the lives of distinguished
      premiers, three courses before us: (1) to charge the
      <i>present</i> value for each kind of wine; (2) to put on a
      certain percentage to the <i>original</i> value of each
      kind; (3) to make a compromise between these two
      courses.<br>
      <br>
      Course 1 seems to me perfectly reasonable; but a very
      plausible objection has been made to it&mdash;that it puts a
      prohibitory price on the valuable wines, and that they
      would remain unconsumed. This would not, however, involve
      any loss to our finances; we could obviously realise the
      enhanced values of the old wines by selling them to
      outsiders, if the members of Common Room would not buy
      them. But I do not advocate this course.<br>
      <br>
      Course 2 would lead to charging 5s. a bottle for Port and
      Chablis alike. The Port-drinker would be "in clover," while
      the Chablis-drinker would probably begin getting his wine
      direct from the merchant instead of from the Common Room
      cellar, which would be a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the
      tariff. Yet I have heard this course advocated, repeatedly,
      as an abstract principle. "You ought to consider the
      <i>original</i> value only," I have been told. "You ought
      to regard the Port-drinker as a private individual, who has
      laid the wine in for himself, and who ought to have all the
      advantages of its enhanced value. You cannot fairly ask him
      for more than what you need to refill the bins with Port,
      <i>plus</i> the percentage thereon needed to meet the
      contingent expenses." I have listened to such arguments,
      but have never been convinced that the course is just. It
      seems to me that the 8s. additional value which the bottle
      of Port has acquired, is the property of <i>Common
      Room</i>, and that Common Room has the power to give it to
      whom it chooses; and it does not seem to me fair to give it
      all to the Port-drinker. What merit is there in preferring
      Port to Chablis, that could justify our selling the
      Port-drinker his wine at less than half what he would have
      to give outside, and charging the Chablis-drinker
      five-thirds of what he would have to give outside? At all
      events, I, as a Port-drinker, do not wish to absorb the
      whole advantage, and would gladly share it with the
      Chablis-drinker. The course I recommend is<br>
      <br>
      Course 3, which is a compromise between 1 and 2, its
      essential principle being to sell the new wines
      <i>above</i> their value, in order to be able to sell the
      old <i>below</i> their value. And it is clearly desirable,
      as far as possible, to make the reductions <i>where they
      will be felt</i>, and the additions <i>where they will not
      be felt.</i> Moreover it seems to me that reduction is most
      felt where it <i>goes down to the next round sum,</i> and
      an addition in the reverse case, <i>i.e.,</i> when it
      <i>starts from a round sum.</i> Thus, if we were to take
      2d. off a 5s. 8d. wine, and add it to a 4s. 4d.&mdash;thus
      selling them at 5s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. the reduction would be
      welcomed, and the addition unnoticed; and the change would
      be a popular one.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The next extract shows with what light-hearted frivolity he
      could approach this tremendous subject of wine:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The consumption of Madeira (B) has been during the past
      year, zero. After careful calculation I estimate that, if
      this rate of consumption be steadily maintained, our
      present stock will last us an infinite number of years. And
      although there may be something monotonous and dreary in
      the prospect of such vast cycles spent in drinking
      second-class Madeira, we may yet cheer ourselves with the
      thought of how economically it can be done.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To assist the Curator in the discharge of his duties, there
      was a Wine Committee, and for its guidance a series of
      rules was drawn up. The first runs as follows: "There shall
      be a Wine Committee, consisting of five persons, including
      the Curator, whose duty it shall be to assist the Curator
      in the management of the cellar." "Hence," wrote Mr.
      Dodgson, "logically it is the bounden duty of the Curator
      'to assist himself.' I decline to say whether this clause
      has ever brightened existence for me&mdash;or whether, in the
      shades of evening, I may ever have been observed leaving
      the Common Room cellars with a small but suspicious-looking
      bundle, and murmuring, 'Assist thyself, assist thyself!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Every Christmas at Christ Church the children of the
      College servants have a party in the Hall. This year he was
      asked to entertain them, and gladly consented to do so. He
      hired a magic lantern and a large number of slides, and
      with their help told the children the three following
      stories: (1) "The Epiphany"; (2) "The Children Lost in the
      Bush"; (3) "Bruno's Picnic."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already referred to the services held in Christ
      Church for the College servants, at which Mr. Dodgson used
      frequently to preach. The way in which he regarded this
      work is very characteristic of the man. "Once more," he
      writes, "I have to thank my Heavenly Father for the great
      blessing and privilege of being allowed to speak for Him!
      May He bless my words to help some soul on its heavenward
      way." After one of these addresses he received a note from
      a member of the congregation, thanking him for what he had
      said. "It is very sweet," he said, "to get such words now
      and then; but there is danger in them if more such come, I
      must beg for silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the year Mr. Dodgson wrote the following letter to
      the Rev. C.A. Goodhart, Rector of Lambourne, Essex:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;Your kind, sympathising and most encouraging
      letter about "Sylvie and Bruno" has deserved a better
      treatment from me than to have been thus kept waiting more
      than two years for an answer. But life is short; and one
      has many other things to do; and I have been for years
      almost hopelessly in arrears in correspondence. I keep a
      register, so that letters which I intend to answer do
      somehow come to the front at last.<br>
      <br>
      In "Sylvie and Bruno" I took courage to introduce what I
      had entirely avoided in the two "Alice" books&mdash;some
      reference to subjects which are, after all, the <i>only</i>
      subjects of real interest in life, subjects which are so
      intimately bound up with every topic of human interest that
      it needs more effort to avoid them than to touch on them;
      and I felt that such a book was more suitable to a clerical
      writer than one of mere fun.<br>
      <br>
      I hope I have not offended many (evidently I have not
      offended <i>you</i>) by putting scenes of mere fun, and
      talk about God, into the same book.<br>
      <br>
      Only one of all my correspondents ever guessed there was
      more to come of the book. She was a child, personally
      unknown to me, who wrote to "Lewis Carroll" a sweet letter
      about the book, in which she said, "I'm so glad it hasn't
      got a regular wind-up, as it shows there is more to
      come!"<br>
      <br>
      There is indeed "more to come." When I came to piece
      together the mass of accumulated material I found it was
      quite <i>double</i> what could be put into one volume. So I
      divided it in the middle; and I hope to bring out "Sylvie
      and Bruno Concluded" next Christmas&mdash;if, that is, my
      Heavenly Master gives me the time and the strength for the
      task; but I am nearly 60, and have no right to count on
      years to come.<br>
      <br>
      In signing my real name, let me beg you not to let the
      information go further&mdash;I have an <i>intense</i> dislike to
      personal publicity; and, the more people there are who know
      nothing of "Lewis Carroll" save his books, the happier I
      am.<br>
      <br>
      Believe me, sincerely yours,<br>
      <br>
      Charles L. Dodgson.

    <p>
      I have made no attempt to chronicle all the games and
      puzzles which Lewis Carroll invented. A list of such as
      have been published will be found in the Bibliographical
      chapter. He intended to bring out a book of "Original Games
      and Puzzles," with illustrations by Miss E. Gertrude
      Thomson. The MS. was, I believe, almost complete before his
      death, and one, at least, of the pictures had been drawn.
      On June 30th he wrote in his Diary, "Invented what I think
      is a new kind of riddle. A Russian had three sons. The
      first, named Rab, became a lawyer; the second, Ymra, became
      a soldier; the third became a sailor. What was his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter written to a child-friend, Miss E.
      Drury, illustrates Lewis Carroll's hatred of bazaars:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ch. Ch., Oxford, <i>Nov</i>. 10, 1892.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Emmie,&mdash;I object to <i>all</i> bazaars on the
      general principle that they are very undesirable schools
      for young ladies, in which they learn to be "too fast" and
      forward, and are more exposed to undesirable acquaintances
      than in ordinary society. And I have, besides that, special
      objections to bazaars connected with charitable or
      religious purposes. It seems to me that they desecrate the
      religious object by their undesirable features, and that
      they take the reality out of all charity by getting people
      to think that they are doing a good action, when their true
      motive is amusement for themselves. Ruskin has put all this
      far better than I can possibly do, and, if I can find the
      passage, and find the time to copy it, I will send it you.
      But <i>time</i> is a very scarce luxury for me!<br>
      <br>
      Always yours affectionately,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.

      In his later years he used often to give lectures on
      various subjects to children. He gave a series on "Logic"
      at the Oxford Girls' High School, but he sometimes went
      further afield, as in the following instance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Went, as arranged with Miss A. Ottley, to the High School
      at Worcester, on a visit. At half-past three I had an
      audience of about a hundred little girls, aged, I should
      think, from about six to fourteen. I showed them two
      arithmetic puzzles on the black-board, and told them
      "Bruno's Picnic." At half-past seven I addressed some
      serious words to a second audience of about a hundred elder
      girls, probably from fifteen to twenty&mdash;an experience of the
      deepest interest to me.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The illustration on the next page will be best explained by
      the following letter which I have received from Mr. Walter
      Lindsay, of Philadelphia, U.S.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Phila., <i>September</i> 12, 1898.<br>
      <br>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;I shall be very glad to furnish what information
      I can with respect to the "Mechanical Humpty Dumpty" which
      I constructed a few years ago, but I must begin by
      acknowledging that, in one sense at least, I did not
      "invent" the figure. The idea was first put into my head by
      an article in the <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, somewhere about
      1891, I suppose, describing a similar contrivance. As a
      devoted admirer of the "Alice" books, I determined to build
      a Humpty Dumpty of my own; but I left the model set by the
      author of the article mentioned, and constructed the figure
      on entirely different lines. In the first place, the figure
      as described in the magazine had very few movements, and
      not very satisfactory ones at that; and in the second
      place, no attempt whatever was made to reproduce, even in a
      general way, the well-known appearance of Tenniel's
      drawing. Humpty, when completed, was about two feet and a
      half high. His face, of course, was white; the lower half
      of the egg was dressed in brilliant blue. His stockings
      were grey, and the famous cravat orange, with a zigzag
      pattern in blue. I am sorry to say that the photograph
      hardly does him justice; but he had travelled to so many
      different places during his career, that he began to be
      decidedly out of shape before he sat for his portrait.<br>

      When Humpty was about to perform, a short "talk" was
      usually given before the curtain rose, explaining the way
      in which the Sheep put the egg on the shelf at the back of
      the little shop, and how Alice went groping along to it.
      And then, just as the explanation had reached the opening
      of the chapter on Humpty Dumpty, the curtain rose, and
      Humpty was discovered, sitting on the wall, and gazing into
      vacancy. As soon as the audience had had time to recover,
      Alice entered, and the conversation was carried on just as
      it is in the book. Humpty Dumpty gesticulated with his
      arms, rolled his eyes, raised his eyebrows, frowned, turned
      up his nose in scorn at Alice's ignorance, and smiled from
      ear to ear when he shook hands with her. Besides this, his
      mouth kept time with his words all through the dialogue,
      which added very greatly to his life-like appearance.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of his huge face, as it changed from one
      expression to another, was ludicrous in the extreme, and we
      were often obliged to repeat sentences in the conversation
      (to "go back to the last remark but one") because the
      audience laughed so loudly over Humpty Dumpty's expression
      of face that they drowned what he was trying to say. The
      funniest effect was the change from the look of
      self-satisfied complacency with which he accompanied the
      words: "The king has promised me&mdash;" to that of towering rage
      when Alice innocently betrays her knowledge of the secret.
      At the close of the scene, when Alice has vainly
      endeavoured to draw him into further conversation, and at
      last walks away in disgust, Humpty loses his balance on the
      wall, recovers himself, totters again, and then falls off
      backwards; at the same time a box full of broken glass is
      dropped on the floor behind the scenes, to represent the
      "heavy crash," which "shook the forest from end to
      end";&mdash;and the curtain falls.<br>
      <br>
      Now, as to how it was all done. Humpty was made of barrel
      hoops, and covered with stiff paper and muslin. His eyes
      were round balls of rags, covered with muslin, drawn
      smoothly, and with the pupil and iris marked on the front.
      These eyes were pivoted to a board, fastened just behind
      the eye-openings in the face. To the eyeballs were sewed
      strong pieces of tape, which passed through screw-eyes on
      the edges of the board, and so down to a row of levers
      which were hinged in the lower part of the figure. One
      lever raised both eyes upward, another moved them both to
      the left, and so on. The eyebrows were of worsted and
      indiarubber knitted together. They were fastened at the
      ends, and raised and lowered by fine white threads passing
      through small holes in the face, and also operated by
      levers. The arms projected into the interior of the
      machine, and the gestures were made by moving the short
      ends inside. The right hand contained a spring clothe-pin,
      by which he was enabled to hold the note&mdash; book in which
      Alice set down the celebrated problem&mdash;

      The movement of the mouth, in talking, was produced by a
      long tape, running down to a pedal, which was controlled by
      the foot of the performer. And the smile consisted of long
      strips of red tape, which were drawn out through slits at
      the corners of the mouth by means of threads which passed
      through holes in the sides of the head. The performer&mdash;who
      was always your humble servant&mdash;stood on a box behind the
      wall, his head just reaching the top of the egg, which was
      open all the way up the back. At the lower end of the
      figure, convenient to the hands of the performer, was the
      row of levers, like a little keyboard; and by striking
      different chords on the keys, any desired expression could
      be produced on the face.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, a performance of this kind without a good Alice
      would be unutterably flat; but the little girl who played
      opposite to Humpty, Miss Nellie K&mdash;, was so exactly the
      counterpart of Alice, both in appearance and disposition,
      that most children thought she was the original, right out
      of the book.<br>
      <br>
      Humpty still exists, but he has not seen active life for
      some years. His own popularity was the cause of his
      retirement; for having given a number of performances (for
      Charity, of course), and delighted many thousands of
      children of all ages, the demands upon his time, from
      Sunday-schools and other institutions, became so numerous
      that the performers were obliged to withdraw him in
      self-defence. He was a great deal of trouble to build, but
      the success he met with and the pleasure he gave more than
      repaid me for the bother; and I am sure that any one else
      who tries it will reach the same conclusion.<br>
      <br>
      Yours sincerely,<br>
      <br>

      At the beginning of 1893 a fierce logical battle was being
      waged between Lewis Carroll and Mr. Cook Wilson, Professor
      of Logic at Oxford. The Professor, in spite of the
      countless arguments that Mr. Dodgson hurled at his head,
      would not confess that he had committed a fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On February 5th the Professor appears to have conceded a
      point, for Mr. Dodgson writes: "Heard from Cook Wilson, who
      has long declined to read a paper which I sent January
      12th, and which seems to me to prove the fallacy of a view
      of his about Hypotheticals. He now offers to read it, if
      <i>I</i> will study a proof he sent, that another problem
      of mine had contradictory <i>data</i>. I have accepted his
      offer, and studied and answered his paper. So I now look
      forward hopefully to the result of his reading mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hopes which he entertained were doomed to be
      disappointed; the controversy bore no fruits save a few
      pamphlets and an enormous amount of correspondence, and
      finally the two antagonists had to agree to differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule Mr. Dodgson was a stern opponent of music-halls
      and music-hall singers; but he made one or two exceptions
      with regard to the latter. For Chevalier he had nothing but
      praise; he heard him at one of his recitals, for he never
      in his life entered a "Variety Theatre." I give the passage
      from his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Went to hear Mr. Albert Chevalier's Recital. I only knew of
      him as being now recognised as <i>facile princeps</i> among
      music-hall singers, and did not remember that I had seen
      him twice or oftener on the stage&mdash;first as "Mr. Hobbs" in
      "Little Lord Fauntleroy," and afterwards as a "horsy" young
      man in a <i>matin&#233;e</i> in which Violet Vanbrugh
      appeared. He was decidedly <i>good</i> as an actor; but as
      a comic singer (with considerable powers of pathos as well)
      he is quite first-rate. His chief merit seems to be the
      earnestness with which he throws himself into the work. The
      songs (mostly his own writing) were quite inoffensive, and
      very funny. I am very glad to be able to think that his
      influence on public taste is towards refinement and purity.
      I liked best "The Future Mrs. 'Awkins," with its taking
      tune, and "My Old Dutch," which revealed powers that, I
      should think, would come out grandly in Robsonian parts,
      such as "The Porter's Knot." "The Little Nipper" was also
      well worth hearing.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodgson's views on Sunday Observance were
      old-fashioned, but he lived up to them, and did not try to
      force them upon people with whose actions he had no
      concern. They were purely matters of "private opinion" with
      him. On October 2nd he wrote to Miss E.G. Thomson, who was
      illustrating his "Three Sunsets":&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Would you kindly do <i>no</i> sketches, or photos, for
      <i>me</i>, on a Sunday? It is, in <i>my</i> view (of
      <i>course</i> I don't condemn any one who differs from me)
      inconsistent with keeping the day holy. I do <i>not</i>
      hold it to be the Jewish "Sabbath," but I <i>do</i> hold it
      to be "the Lord's Day," and so to be made very distinct
      from the other days.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In December, the Logical controversy being over for a time,
      Mr. Dodgson invented a new problem to puzzle his
      mathematical friends with, which was called "The Monkey and
      Weight Problem." A rope is supposed to be hung over a wheel
      fixed to the roof of a building; at one end of the rope a
      weight is fixed, which exactly counterbalances a monkey
      which is hanging on to the other end. Suppose that the
      monkey begins to climb the rope, what will be the result?
      The following extract from the Diary illustrates the
      several possible answers which may be given:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Got Professor Clifton's answer to the "Monkey and Weight
      Problem." It is very curious, the different views taken by
      good mathematicians. Price says the weight goes <i>up</i>,
      with increasing velocity; Clifton (and Harcourt) that it
      goes <i>up</i>, at the same rate as the monkey; while
      Sampson says that it goes <i>down</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On December 24th Mr. Dodgson received the first twelve
      copies of "Sylvie and Bruno Concluded," just about four
      years after the appearance of the first part of the story.
      In this second volume the two fairy children are as
      delightful as ever; it also contains what I think most
      people will agree to be the most beautiful poem Lewis
      Carroll ever wrote, "Say, what is the spell, when her
      fledglings are cheeping?" (p. 305). In the preface he pays
      a well-deserved compliment to Mr. Harry Furniss for his
      wonderfully clever pictures; he also explains how the book
      was written, showing that many of the amusing remarks of
      Bruno had been uttered by real children. He makes allusion
      to two books, which only his death prevented him from
      finishing&mdash;"Original Games and Puzzles," and a paper on
      "Sport," viewed from the standpoint of the humanitarian.
      From a literary point of view the second volume of "Sylvie
      and Bruno" lacks unity; a fairy tale is all very well, and
      a novel also is all very well, but the combination of the
      two is surely a mistake. However, the reader who cares more
      for the spirit than the letter will not notice this
      blemish; to him "Sylvie and Bruno Concluded" will be
      interesting and helpful, as the revelation of a very
      beautiful personality.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      You have made everything turn out just as I should have
      chosen [writes a friend to whom he had sent a copy], and
      made right all that disappointed me in the first part. I
      have not only to thank you for writing an interesting book,
      but for writing a helpful one too. I am sure that "Sylvie
      and Bruno" has given me many thoughts that will help me all
      life through. One cannot know "Sylvie" without being the
      better for it. You may say that "Mister Sir" is not
      consciously meant to be yourself, but I cannot help feeling
      that he is. As "Mister Sir" talks, I hear your voice in
      every word. I think, perhaps, that is why I like the book
      so much.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have received an interesting letter from Mr. Furniss,
      bearing upon the subject of "Sylvie and Bruno," and Lewis
      Carroll's methods of work. The letter runs as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I have illustrated stories of most of our leading authors,
      and I can safely say that Lewis Carroll was the only one
      who cared to understand the illustrations to his own book.
      He was the W. S. Gilbert for children, and, like Gilbert
      producing one of his operas, Lewis Carroll took infinite
      pains to study every detail in producing his extraordinary
      and delightful books. Mr. Gilbert, as every one knows, has
      a model of the stage; he puts up the scenery, draws every
      figure, moves them about just as he wishes the real actors
      to move about. Lewis Carroll was precisely the same. This,
      of course, led to a great deal of work and trouble, and
      made the illustrating of his books more a matter of
      artistic interest than of professional profit. I was
      <i>seven years</i> illustrating his last work, and during
      that time I had the pleasure of many an interesting meeting
      with the fascinating author, and I was quite repaid for the
      trouble I took, not only by his generous appreciation of my
      efforts, but by the liberal remuneration he gave for the
      work, and also by the charm of having intercourse with the
      interesting, if somewhat erratic genius.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A book very different in character from "Sylvie and Bruno,"
      but under the same well-known pseudonym, appeared about the
      same time. I refer to "Pillow Problems," the second part of
      the series entitled "Curiosa Mathematica."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pillow Problems thought out during wakeful hours" is a
      collection of mathematical problems, which Mr. Dodgson
      solved while lying awake at night. A few there are to which
      the title is not strictly applicable, but all alike were
      worked out mentally before any diagram or word of the
      solution was committed to paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author says that his usual practice was to write down
      the <i>answer</i> first of all, and afterwards the question
      and its solution. His motive, he says, for publishing these
      problems was not from any desire to display his powers of
      mental calculation. Those who knew him will readily believe
      this, though they will hardly be inclined to accept his own
      modest estimate of those powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the book was intended, not for the select few who can
      scale the mountain heights of advanced mathematics, but for
      the much larger class of ordinary mathematicians, and they
      at least will be able to appreciate the gifted author, and
      to wonder how he could follow so clearly in his head the
      mental diagrams and intricate calculations involved in some
      of these "Pillow Problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief motive in publishing the book was to show how, by
      a little determination, the mind "can be made to
      concentrate itself on some intellectual subject (not
      necessarily mathematics), and thus banish those petty
      troubles and vexations which most people experience, and
      which&mdash;unless the mind be otherwise occupied&mdash;<i>will</i>
      persist in invading the hours of night." And this remedy,
      as he shows, serves a higher purpose still. In a paragraph
      which deserves quoting at length, as it gives us a
      momentary glimpse of his refined and beautiful character,
      he says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Perhaps I may venture for a moment to use a more serious
      tone, and to point out that there are mental troubles, much
      worse than mere worry, for which an absorbing object of
      thought may serve as a remedy. There are sceptical
      thoughts, which seem for the moment to uproot the firmest
      faith: there are blasphemous thoughts, which dart unbidden
      into the most reverent souls: there are unholy thoughts,
      which torture with their hateful presence the fancy that
      would fain be pure. Against all these some real mental work
      is a most helpful ally. That "unclean spirit" of the
      parable, who brought back with him seven others more wicked
      than himself, only did so because he found the chamber
      "swept and garnished," and its owner sitting with folded
      hands. Had he found it all alive with the "busy hum" of
      active <i>work</i>, there would have been scant welcome for
      him and his seven!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It would have robbed the book of its true character if
      Lewis Carroll had attempted to improve on the work done in
      his head, and consequently we have the solutions exactly as
      he worked them out before setting them down on paper. Of
      the Problems themselves there is not much to be said here;
      they are original, and some of them (e.g., No. 52)
      expressed in a style peculiarly the author's own. The
      subjects included in their range are Arithmetic, Algebra,
      Pure Geometry (Plane), Trigonometry, Algebraic Geometry,
      and Differential Calculus; and there is one Problem to
      which Mr. Dodgson says he "can proudly point," in
      "Transcendental Probabilities," which is here given: "A bag
      contains two counters, as to which nothing is known except
      that each is either black or white. Ascertain their colour
      without taking them out of the bag." The answer is, "One is
      black and the other white." For the solution the reader is
      referred to the book itself, a study of which will well
      repay him, apart from the chance he may have of discovering
      some mistake, and the consequent joy thereat!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few extracts from the Diary follow, written during the
      early part of 1894:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Feb.</i> 1<i>st.&mdash;Dies notandus.</i> As Ragg was reading
      Prayers, and Bayne and I were the only M.A.'s in the
      stalls, I tried the experiment of going to the lectern and
      reading the lesson. I did not hesitate much, but feel it
      too great a strain on the nerves to be tried often. Then I
      went to the Latin Chapel for Holy Communion. Only Paget
      (Dean) and Dr. Huntley came: so, for the first time in my
      recollection, it had to be given up. Then I returned to my
      rooms, and found in <i>The Standard</i> the very important
      communication from Gladstone denying the rumour that he has
      decided upon resigning the Premiership, but admitting that,
      owing to failing powers, it may come at any moment. It will
      make a complete change in the position of politics! Then I
      got, from Cook Wilson, what I have been so long trying
      for&mdash;an accepted transcript of the fallacious argument over
      which we have had an (apparently) endless fight. I think
      the end is near, <i>now</i>.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Feb.</i> 4<i>th.</i>&mdash;The idea occurred to me that it
      might be a pleasant variation in Backgammon to throw
      <i>three</i> dice, and choose any two of the three numbers.
      The average quality of the throws would be much raised. I
      reckon that the chance of "6, 6" would be about two and a
      half what it now is. It would also furnish a means, similar
      to giving points in billiards, for equalising players: the
      weaker might use three dice, the other using two. I think
      of calling it "Thirdie Backgammon."<br>
      <br>
      <i>March</i> 31<i>st.</i>&mdash;Have just got printed, as a
      leaflet, "A Disputed Point in Logic"&mdash;the point Professor
      Wilson and I have been arguing so long. This paper is
      wholly in his own words, and puts the point very clearly. I
      think of submitting it to all my logical friends.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      "A Disputed Point in Logic" appeared also, I believe, in
      <i>Mind</i>, July, 1894.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems a fitting place in which to speak of a side of
      Mr. Dodgson's character of which he himself was naturally
      very reticent&mdash;his wonderful generosity. My own experience
      of him was of a man who was always ready to do one a
      kindness, even though it put him to great expense and
      inconvenience; but of course I did not know, during his
      lifetime, that my experience of him was the same as that of
      all his other friends. The income from his books and other
      sources, which might have been spent in a life of luxury
      and selfishness, he distributed lavishly where he saw it
      was needed, and in order to do this he always lived in the
      most simple way. To make others happy was the Golden Rule
      of his life. On August 31st he wrote, in a letter to a
      friend, Miss Mary Brown: "And now what am I to tell you
      about myself? To say I am quite well 'goes without saying'
      with me. In fact, my life is so strangely free from all
      trial and trouble that I cannot doubt my own happiness is
      one of the talents entrusted to me to 'occupy' with, till
      the Master shall return, by doing something to make other
      lives happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      In several instances, where friends in needy circumstances
      have written to him for loans of money, he has answered
      them, "I will not <i>lend</i>, but I will <i>give</i> you
      the &#163;100 you ask for." To help child-friends who
      wanted to go on the stage, or to take up music as a
      profession, he has introduced them to leading actors and
      actresses, paid for them having lessons in singing from the
      best masters, sent round circulars to his numerous
      acquaintances begging them to patronise the first concert
      or recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing his books he never attempted to win popularity
      by acceding to the prejudices and frailties of the age&mdash;his
      one object was to make his books useful and helpful and
      ennobling. Like the great Master, in whose steps he so
      earnestly strove to follow, he "went about doing good." And
      one is glad to think that even his memory is being made to
      serve the same purpose. The "Alice" cots are a worthy
      sequel to his generous life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Dodgson, with all his boasted health, was not
      absolutely proof against disease, for on February 12, 1895,
      he writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Tenth day of a rather bad attack of influenza of the ague
      type. Last night the fever rose to a great height, partly
      caused by a succession of <i>five</i> visitors. One,
      however, was of my own seeking&mdash;Dean Paget, to whom I was
      thankful to be able to tell all I have had in my mind for a
      year or more, as to our Chapel services <i>not</i> being as
      helpful as they could be made. The chief fault is extreme
      <i>rapidity</i>. I long ago gave up the attempt to say the
      Confession at that pace; and now I say it, and the Lord's
      Prayer, close together, and never hear a word of the
      Absolution. Also many of the Lessons are quite unedifying.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On July 11th he wrote to my brother on the subject of a
      paper about Eternal Punishment, which was to form the first
      of a series of essays on Religious Difficulties:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am sending you the article on "Eternal Punishment" as it
      is. There is plenty of matter for consideration, as to
      which I shall be glad to know your views.<br>
      <br>
      Also if there are other points, connected with religion,
      where you feel that perplexing difficulties exist, I should
      be glad to know of them in order to see whether I can see
      my way to saying anything helpful.<br>
      <br>
      But I had better add that I do not want to deal with any
      such difficulties, <i>unless</i> they tend to affect
      <i>life. Speculative</i> difficulties which do not affect
      conduct, and which come into collision with any of the
      principles which I intend to state as axioms, lie outside
      the scope of my book. These axioms are:&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        (1) Human conduct is capable of being <i>right</i>, and
        of being <i>wrong</i>.<br>
        <br>
        (2) I possess Free-Will, and am able to choose between
        right and wrong.<br>
        <br>
        (3) I have in some cases chosen wrong.<br>
        <br>
        (4) I am responsible for choosing wrong.<br>
        <br>
        (5) I am responsible to a person.<br>
        <br>
        (6) This person is perfectly good.
      </blockquote>I call them axioms, because I have no
      <i>proofs</i> to offer for them. There will probably be
      others, but these are all I can think of just now.
    </blockquote>

      The Rev. H. Hopley, Vicar of Westham, has sent me the
      following interesting account of a sermon Mr. Dodgson
      preached at his church:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In the autumn of 1895 the Vicar of Eastbourne was to have
      preached my Harvest Sermon at Westham, a village five miles
      away; but something or other intervened, and in the middle
      of the week I learned he could not come. A mutual friend
      suggested my asking Mr. Dodgson, who was then in
      Eastbourne, to help me, and I went with him to his rooms. I
      was quite a stranger to Mr. Dodgson; but knowing from
      hearsay how reluctant he usually was to preach, I
      apologised and explained my position&mdash;with Sunday so near at
      hand. After a moment's hesitation he consented, and in a
      most genial manner made me feel quite at ease as to the
      abruptness of my petition. On the morrow he came over to my
      vicarage, and made friends with my daughters, teaching them
      some new manner of playing croquet [probably Castle
      Croquet], and writing out for them puzzles and anagrams
      that he had composed.<br>
      <br>
      The following letter was forwarded on the Saturday:&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        "7, Lushington Road, Eastbourne,<br>
        <br>
        <i>September</i> 26, 1895.<br>
        <br>
        Dear Mr. Hopley,&mdash;I think you will excuse the liberty I am
        taking in asking you to give me some food after the
        service on Sunday, so that I may have no need to catch
        the train, but can walk back at leisure. This will save
        me from the worry of trying to conclude at an exact
        minute, and you, perhaps, from the trouble of finding
        short hymns, to save time. It will not, I hope, cause
        your cook any trouble, as my regular rule here is
        <i>cold</i> dinner on Sundays. This not from any
        "Sabbatarian" theory, but from the wish to let our
        <i>employ&#233;s</i> have the day <i>wholly</i> at
        their own disposal.<br>
        <br>
        I beg Miss Hopley's acceptance of the enclosed papers&mdash;
        (puzzles and diagrams.)<br>
        <br>
        Believe me, very truly yours,<br>
        <br>
        C.L. Dodgson."
      </blockquote><br>
      On Sunday our grand old church was crowded, and, although
      our villagers are mostly agricultural labourers, yet they
      breathlessly listened to a sermon forty minutes long, and
      apparently took in every word of it. It was quite
      extempore, in very simple words, and illustrated by some
      delightful and most touching stories of children. I only
      wish there had been a shorthand-writer there.<br>
      <br>
      In the vestry after service, while he was signing his name
      in the Preachers' Book, a church officer handed him a bit
      of paper. "Mr. Dodgson, would you very kindly write your
      name on that?" "Sir!" drawing himself up sternly&mdash;"Sir, I
      never do that for any one"&mdash;and then, more kindly, "You see,
      if I did it for one, I must do it for all."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      An amusing incident in Mr. Dodgson's life is connected with
      the well-known drama, "Two Little Vagabonds." I give the
      story as he wrote it in his Diary:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Nov.</i> 28<i>th.&mdash;Matin&#233;e</i> at the Princess's
      of "Two Little Vagabonds," a very sensational melodrama,
      capitally acted. "Dick" and "Wally" were played by Kate
      Tyndall and Sydney Fairbrother, whom I guess to be about
      fifteen and twelve. Both were excellent, and the latter
      remarkable for the perfect realism of her acting. There was
      some beautiful religious dialogue between "Wally" and a
      hospital nurse&mdash; most reverently spoken, and reverently
      received by the audience.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Dec.</i> 17<i>th.</i>&mdash;I have given books to Kate Tyndall
      and Sydney Fairbrother, and have heard from them, and find
      I was entirely mistaken in taking them for children. Both
      are married women!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following is an extract from a letter written in 1896
      to one of his sisters, in allusion to a death which had
      recently occurred in the family:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It is getting increasingly difficult now to remember
      <i>which</i> of one's friends remain alive, and
      <i>which</i> have gone "into the land of the great
      departed, into the silent land." Also, such news comes less
      and less as a shock, and more and more one realises that it
      is an experience each of <i>us</i> has to face before long.
      That fact is getting <i>less</i> dreamlike to me now, and I
      sometimes think what a grand thing it will be to be able to
      say to oneself, "Death is <i>over</i> now; there is not
      <i>that</i> experience to be faced again."<br>
      <br>
      I am beginning to think that, if the <i>books I</i> am
      still hoping to write are to be done <i>at all,</i> they
      must be done <i>now</i>, and that I am <i>meant</i> thus to
      utilise the splendid health I have had, unbroken, for the
      last year and a half, and the working powers that are fully
      as great as, if not greater, than I have ever had. I
      brought with me here (this letter was written from
      Eastbourne) the MS., such as it is (very fragmentary and
      unarranged) for the book about religious difficulties, and
      I meant, when I came here, to devote myself to that, but I
      have changed my plan. It seems to me that <i>that</i>
      subject is one that hundreds of living men could do, if
      they would only try, <i>much</i> better than I could,
      whereas there is no living man who could (or at any rate
      who would take the trouble to) arrange and finish and
      publish the second part of the "Logic." Also, I <i>have</i>
      the Logic book in my head; it will only need three or four
      months to write out, and I have <i>not</i> got the other
      book in my head, and it might take years to think out. So I
      have decided to get Part ii. finished <i>first</i>, and I
      am working at it day and night. I have taken to early
      rising, and sometimes sit down to my work before seven, and
      have one and a half hours at it before breakfast. The book
      will be a great novelty, and will help, I fully believe, to
      make the study of Logic <i>far</i> easier than it now is.
      And it will, I also believe, be a help to religious thought
      by giving <i>clearness</i> of conception and of expression,
      which may enable many people to face, and conquer, many
      religious difficulties for themselves. So I do really
      regard it as work for <i>God</i>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Another letter, written a few months later to Miss Dora
      Abdy, deals with the subject of "Reverence," which Mr.
      Dodgson considered a virtue not held in sufficient esteem
      nowadays:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My Dear Dora,&mdash;In correcting the proofs of "Through the
      Looking-Glass" (which is to have "An Easter Greeting"
      inserted at the end), I am reminded that in that letter (I
      enclose a copy), I had tried to express my thoughts on the
      very subject we talked about last night&mdash;the relation of
      <i>laughter</i> to religious thought. One of the hardest
      things in the world is to convey a meaning accurately from
      one mind to another, but the <i>sort</i> of meaning I want
      to convey to other minds is that while the laughter of
      <i>joy</i> is in full harmony with our deeper life, the
      laughter of amusement should be kept apart from it. The
      danger is too great of thus learning to look at solemn
      things in a spirit of <i>mockery</i>, and to seek in them
      opportunities for exercising <i>wit</i>. That is the spirit
      which has spoiled, for me, the beauty of some of the Bible.
      Surely there is a deep meaning in our prayer, "Give us an
      heart to love and <i>dread</i> Thee." We do not mean
      <i>terror</i>: but a dread that will harmonise with love;
      "respect" we should call it as towards a human being,
      "reverence" as towards God and all religious things.<br>
      <br>
      Yours affectionately,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In his "Game of Logic" Lewis Carroll introduced an original
      method of working logical problems by means of diagrams;
      this method he superseded in after years for a much simpler
      one, the method of "Subscripts."
    </p>
    <p>
      In "Symbolic Logic, Part i." (London: Macmillan, 1896) he
      employed both methods. The Introduction is specially
      addressed "to Learners," whom Lewis Carroll advises to read
      the book straight through, without <i>dipping</i>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      This Rule [he says] is very desirable with other kinds of
      books&mdash;such as novels, for instance, where you may easily
      spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from
      the story by dipping into it further on, so that what the
      author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a
      matter of course. Some people, I know, make a practice of
      looking into vol. iii. first, just to see how the story
      ends; and perhaps it <i>is</i> as well just to know that
      all ends <i>happily</i>&mdash;that the much persecuted lovers
      <i>do</i> marry after all, that he is proved to be quite
      innocent of the murder, that the wicked cousin is
      completely foiled in his plot, and gets the punishment he
      deserves, and that the rich uncle in India (<i>Qu.</i> Why
      in <i>India ? Ans.</i> Because, somehow, uncles never
      <i>can</i> get rich anywhere else) dies at exactly the
      right moment&mdash;before taking the trouble to read vol i. This,
      I say, is <i>just</i> permissible with a <i>novel</i>,
      where vol. iii. has a <i>meaning</i>, even for those who
      have not read the earlier part of the story; but with a
      <i>scientific</i> book, it is sheer insanity. You will find
      the latter part <i>hopelessly</i> unintelligible, if you
      read it before reaching it in regular course.

      The year 1897, the last complete year which he was destined
      to spend, began for Mr. Dodgson at Guildford. On January
      3rd he preached in the morning at the beautiful old church
      of S. Mary's, the church which he always attended when he
      was staying with his sisters at the Chestnuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 5th he began a course of Logic Lectures at Abbot's
      Hospital. The Rev. A. Kingston, late curate of Holy Trinity
      and S. Mary's Parishes, Guildford, had requested him to do
      this, and he had given his promise if as many as six people
      could be got together to hear him. Mr. Kingston canvassed
      the town so well that an audience of about thirty attended
      the first lecture.

      A long Sunday walk was always a feature of Mr. Dodgson's
      life in the vacations. In earlier years the late Mr. W.
      Watson was his usual companion at Guildford. The two men
      were in some respects very much alike; a peculiar
      gentleness of character, a winning charm of manner which no
      one could resist, distinguished them both. After Mr.
      Watson's death his companion was usually one of the
      following Guildford clergymen: the Rev. J.H. Robson, LL.D.,
      the Rev. H.R. Ware, and the Rev. A. Kingston.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 26th Mr. Dodgson paid a visit to the Girls' High
      School, to show the pupils some mathematical puzzles, and
      to teach the elder ones his "Memoria Technica." On the 28th
      he returned to Oxford, so as to be up in time for term.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that he always refused invitations to dinner;
      accordingly his friends who knew of this peculiarity, and
      wished to secure him for a special evening, dared not
      actually invite him, but wrote him little notes stating
      that on such and such days they would be dining at home.
      Thus there is an entry in his Journal for February 10th:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Dined with Mrs. G&mdash;(She had not sent an 'invitation'&mdash;only
      'information')."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      His system of symbolic logic enabled him to work out the
      most complex problems with absolute certainty in a
      surprisingly short time. Thus he wrote on the 15th: "Made a
      splendid logic-problem, about "great-grandsons" (modelled
      on one by De Morgan). My method of solution is quite new,
      and I greatly doubt if any one will solve the Problem. I
      have sent it to Cook Wilson."
    </p>
    <p>
      On March 7th he preached in the University Church, the
      first occasion on which he had done so:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      There is now [he writes] a system established of a course
      of six sermons at S. Mary's each year, for University men
      <i>only</i>, and specially meant for undergraduates. They
      are preached, preceded by a few prayers and a hymn, at
      half-past eight. This evening ended the course for this
      term: and it was my great privilege to preach. It has been
      the most formidable sermon I have ever had to preach, and
      it is a <i>great</i> relief to have it over. I took, as
      text, Job xxviii. 28, "And unto man he said, The fear of
      the Lord, that is wisdom"&mdash;and the prayer in the Litany
      "Give us an heart to love and dread thee." It lasted
      three-quarters of an hour.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One can imagine how he would have treated the subject. The
      views which he held on the subject of reverence were, so at
      least it appears to me, somewhat exaggerated; they are well
      expressed in a letter which he wrote to a friend of his,
      during the year, and which runs as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear&mdash;, After changing my mind several times, I have at last
      decided to venture to ask a favour of you, and to trust
      that you will not misinterpret my motives in doing so.<br>
      <br>
      The favour I would ask is, that you will not tell me any
      more stories, such as you did on Friday, of remarks which
      children are said to have made on very sacred
      subjects&mdash;remarks which most people would recognise as
      irreverent, if made by <i>grown-up people</i>, but which
      are assumed to be innocent when made by children who are
      unconscious of any irreverence, the strange conclusion
      being drawn that they are therefore innocent when
      <i>repeated</i> by a grown-up person.<br>
      <br>
      The misinterpretation I would guard against is, your
      supposing that I regard such repetition as always
      <i>wrong</i> in any grown-up person. Let me assure you that
      I do <i>not</i> so regard it. I am always willing to
      believe that those who repeat such stories differ wholly
      from myself in their views of what is, and what is not,
      fitting treatment of sacred things, and I fully recognise
      that what would certainly be wrong in <i>me</i>, is not
      necessarily so in <i>them</i>.<br>
      <br>
      So I simply ask it as a personal favour to myself. The
      hearing of that anecdote gave me so much pain, and spoiled
      so much the pleasure of my tiny dinner-party, that I feel
      sure you will kindly spare me such in future.<br>
      <br>
      One further remark. There are quantities of such anecdotes
      going about. I don't in the least believe that 5 per cent.
      of them were ever said by <i>children</i>. I feel sure that
      most of them are concocted by people who <i>wish</i> to
      bring sacred subjects into ridicule&mdash;sometimes by people who
      <i>wish</i> to undermine the belief that others have in
      religious truths: for there is no surer way of making one's
      beliefs <i>unreal</i> than by learning to associate them
      with ludicrous ideas.<br>
      <br>
      Forgive the freedom with which I have said all this.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely yours,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The entry in the Diary for April 11th (Sunday) is
      interesting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Went my eighteen-mile round by Besilsleigh. From my rooms
      back to them again, took me five hours and twenty-seven
      minutes. Had "high tea" at twenty minutes past seven. This
      entails only leaving a plate of cold meat, and gives much
      less trouble than hot dinner at six.<br>
      <br>
      Dinner at six has been my rule since January 31st, when it
      began&mdash;I then abandoned the seven o'clock Sunday dinner, of
      which I entirely disapprove. It has prevented, for two
      terms, the College Servants' Service.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On May 12th he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      As the Prince of Wales comes this afternoon to open the
      Town Hall, I went round to the Deanery to invite them to
      come through my rooms upon the roof, to see the procession
      arrive.... A party of about twenty were on my roof in the
      afternoon, including Mrs. Moberly, Mrs. Driver, and Mrs.
      Baynes, and most, if not all, of the children in Christ
      Church. Dinner in Hall at eight. The Dean had the Prince on
      his right, and Lord Salisbury on his left. My place was
      almost <i>vis&mdash;&#224;&mdash;vis</i> with the Prince. He and the
      Dean were the only speakers. We did not get out of Hall
      till nearly ten.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In June he bought a "Whiteley Exerciser," and fixed it up
      in his rooms. One would have thought that he would have
      found his long walks sufficient exercise (an eighteen-mile
      round was, as we have seen, no unusual thing for him to
      undertake), but apparently it was not so. He was so pleased
      with the "Exerciser," that he bought several more of them,
      and made presents of them to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an instance of his broad-mindedness, the following
      extract from his Diary for June 20th is interesting. It
      must be premised that E&mdash;was a young friend of his who had
      recently become a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and
      that their place of worship in Oxford is dedicated to S.
      Aloysius.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I went with E&mdash; to S. Aloysius. There was much beauty in the
      service, part of which consisted in a procession, with
      banner, all round the church, carrying the Host, preceded
      by a number of girls in white, with veils (who had all had
      their first communion that morning), strewing flowers. Many
      of them were quite little things of about seven. The sermon
      (by Father Richardson) was good and interesting, and in a
      very loyal tone about the Queen.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A letter he wrote some years before to a friend who had
      asked him about his religious opinions reveals the same
      catholicity of mind:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am a member of the English Church, and have taken
      Deacon's Orders, but did not think fit (for reasons I need
      not go into) to take Priest's Orders. My dear father was
      what is called a "High Churchman," and I naturally adopted
      those views, but have always felt repelled by the yet
      higher development called "Ritualism."<br>
      <br>
      But I doubt if I am fully a "High Churchman" now. I find
      that as life slips away (I am over fifty now), and the life
      on the other side of the great river becomes more and more
      the reality, of which <i>this</i> is only a shadow, that
      the petty distinctions of the many creeds of Christendom
      tend to slip away as well&mdash;leaving only the great truths
      which all Christians believe alike. More and more, as I
      read of the Christian religion, as Christ preached it, I
      stand amazed at the forms men have given to it, and the
      fictitious barriers they have built up between themselves
      and their brethren. I believe that when you and I come to
      lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold
      of the great truths Christ taught us&mdash;our own utter
      worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has
      brought us back to our one Father, and made us His
      brethren, and so brethren to one another&mdash;we shall have all
      we need to guide us through the shadows.<br>
      <br>
      Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer
      to&mdash;that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way
      of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it
      is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we
      are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially
      say, "I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross
      of Calvary."

      He spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne as usual,
      frequently walking over to Hastings, which is about twenty
      miles off. A good many of his mornings were spent in giving
      lectures and telling stories at schools.

      A letter to the widow of an old college friend reveals the

    <blockquote>
      2, Bedford Well Road, Eastbourne,<br>
      <br>
      <i>August</i> 2, 1897.<br>
      <br>
      My Dear Mrs. Woodhouse,&mdash;Your letter, with its mournful
      news, followed me down here, and I only got it on Saturday
      night; so I was not able to be with you in thought when the
      mortal remains of my dear old friend were being committed
      to the ground; to await the time when our Heavenly Father
      shall have accomplished the number of His elect, and when
      you and I shall once more meet the loved ones from whom we
      are, for a little while only&mdash;what a little while even a
      long human life lasts!&mdash;parted in sorrow, yet <i>not</i>
      sorrowing as those without hope.<br>
      <br>
      You will be sure without words of mine, that you have my
      true and deep sympathy. Of all the friends I made at Ch.
      Ch., your husband was the very <i>first</i> who spoke to
      me&mdash;across the dinner-table in Hall. That is forty-six years
      ago, but I remember, as if it were only yesterday, the
      kindly smile with which he spoke....

      On November 20th he spent the day in London, with the
      object of seeing "The Little Minister" at the Haymarket. "A
      beautiful play, beautifully acted," he calls it, and says
      that he should like to see it "again and again." He
      especially admired the acting of Mrs. Cyril Maude (Miss
      Winifred Emery) as Lady Babbie. This was the last
      theatrical performance he ever witnessed.

      He apparently kept rough notes for his Diary, and only
      wrote it up every few weeks, as there are no entries at all

      As my story of Lewis Carroll's life draws near its end, I
      have received some "Stray Reminiscences" from Sir George
      Baden-Powell, M.P., which, as they refer to several
      different periods of time, are as appropriate here as in
      any other part of the book. The Rev. E.H. Dodgson, referred
      to in these reminiscences, is a younger brother of Lewis
      Carroll's; he spent several years of his life upon the
      remote island of Tristan d'Acunha, where there were only
      about seventy or eighty inhabitants besides himself. About
      once a year a ship used to call, when the island-folk would
      exchange their cattle for cloth, corn, tea, &amp;c., which
      they could not produce themselves. The island is volcanic
      in origin, and is exposed to the most terrific gales; the
      building used as a church stood at some distance from Mr.
      Dodgson's dwelling, and on one occasion the wind was so
      strong that he had to crawl on his hands and knees for the
      whole distance that separated the two buildings.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My first introduction (writes Sir George Baden-Powell) to
      the author of "Through the Looking-Glass" was about the
      year 1870 or 1871, and under appropriate conditions! I was
      then coaching at Oxford with the well-known Rev. E. Hatch,
      and was on friendly terms with his bright and pretty
      children. Entering his house one day, and facing the
      dining-room, I heard mysterious noises under the table, and
      saw the cloth move as if some one were hiding. Children's
      legs revealed it as no burglar, and there was nothing for
      it but to crawl upon them, roaring as a lion. Bursting in
      upon them in their strong-hold under the table, I was met
      by the staid but amused gaze of a reverend gentleman.
      Frequently afterwards did I see and hear "Lewis Carroll"
      entertaining the youngsters in his inimitable way.<br>
      <br>
      We became friends, and greatly did I enjoy intercourse with
      him over various minor Oxford matters. In later years, at
      one time I saw much of him, in quite another
      <i>r&#244;le</i>&mdash;namely that of ardent sympathy with the,
      as he thought, ill-treated and deserted islanders of
      Tristan d'Acunha. His brother, it will be remembered, had
      voluntarily been left at that island with a view to
      ministering to the spiritual and educational needs of the
      few settlers, and sent home such graphic accounts and
      urgent demands for aid, that "Lewis Carroll" spared no
      pains to organise assistance and relief. At his instance I
      brought the matter before Government and the House of
      Commons, and from that day to this frequent communication
      has been held with the islanders, and material assistance
      has been rendered them&mdash;thanks to the warm heart of "Lewis
      Carroll."

      On December 23, 1897, as the note in his Diary states, he
      went down, in accordance with his usual custom, to
      Guildford, to spend Christmas with his sisters at the
      Chestnuts. He seemed to be in his ordinary health, and in
      the best of spirits, and there was nothing to show that the
      end was so near.

      At Guildford he was hard at work upon the second part of
      his "Symbolic Logic," spending most of the day over this
      task. This book, alas! he was not destined to finish, which
      is the more to be regretted as it will be exceedingly
      difficult for any one else to take up the thread of the
      argument, even if any one could be found willing to give
      the great amount of time and trouble which would be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On January 5th my father, the Rev. C.S. Collingwood, Rector
      of Southwick, near Sunderland, died after a very short
      illness. The telegram which brought Mr. Dodgson the news of
      this contained the request that he would come at once. He
      determined to travel north the next day&mdash;but it was not to
      be so. An attack of influenza, which began only with slight
      hoarseness, yet enough to prevent him from following his
      usual habit of reading family prayers, was pronounced next
      morning to be sufficiently serious to forbid his
      undertaking a journey. At first his illness seemed a
      trifle, but before a week had passed bronchial symptoms had
      developed, and Dr. Gabb, the family physician, ordered him
      to keep his bed. His breathing rapidly became hard and
      laborious, and he had to be propped up with pillows. A few
      days before his death he asked one of his sisters to read
      him that well-known hymn, every verse of which ends with
      'Thy Will be done.' To another he said that his illness was
      a great trial of his patience. How great a trial it must
      have been it is hard for us to understand. With the work he
      had set himself still uncompleted, with a sense of youth
      and joyousness, which sixty years of the battle of life had
      in no way dulled, Lewis Carroll had to face death. He
      seemed to know that the struggle was over. "Take away those
      pillows," he said on the 13th, "I shall need them no more."
      The end came about half-past two on the afternoon of the
      14th. One of his sisters was in the room at the time, and
      she only noticed that the hard breathing suddenly ceased.
      The nurse, whom she summoned, at first hoped that this was
      a sign that he had taken a turn for the better. And so,
      indeed, he had&mdash;he had passed from a world of incompleteness
      and disappointment, to another where God is putting his
      beautiful soul to nobler and grander work than was possible
      for him here, where he is learning to comprehend those
      difficulties which used to puzzle him so much, and where
      that infinite Love, which he mirrored so wonderfully in his
      own life, is being revealed to him "face to face."
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with his expressed wish, the funeral was
      simple in the extreme&mdash;flowers, and flowers only, adorned
      the plain coffin. There was no hearse to drag it up the
      steep incline that leads to the beautiful cemetery where he
      lies. The service was taken by Dean Paget and Canon Grant,
      Rector of Holy Trinity and S. Mary's, Guildford. The
      mourners who followed him in the quiet procession were
      few&mdash;but the mourners who were not there, and many of whom
      had never seen him&mdash;who shall tell <i>their</i> number?
    </p>
    <p>
      After the grave had been filled up, the wreaths which had
      covered the coffin were placed upon it. Many were from
      "child-friends" and bore such inscriptions as "From two of
      his child-friends"&mdash;"To the sweetest soul that ever looked
      with human eyes," &amp;c. Then the mourners left him alone
      there&mdash;up on the pleasant downs where he had so often
      walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A marble cross, under the shadow of a pine, marks the spot,
      and beneath his own name they have engraved the name of
      "Lewis Carroll," that the children who pass by may remember
      their friend, who is now&mdash;himself a child in all that makes
      childhood most attractive&mdash;in that "Wonderland" which
      outstrips all our dreams and hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot forbear quoting from Professor Sanday's sermon at
      Christ Church on the Sunday after his death:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The world will think of Lewis Carroll as one who opened out
      a new vein in literature, a new and a delightful vein,
      which added at once mirth and refinement to life.... May we
      not say that from our courts at Christ Church there has
      flowed into the literature of our time a rill, bright and
      sparkling, health-giving and purifying, wherever its waters
      extend?

      On the following Sunday Dean Paget, in the course of a
      sermon on the "Virtue of Simplicity," said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We may differ, according to our difference of taste or
      temperament, in appraising Charles Dodgson's genius; but
      that that great gift was his, that his best work ranks with
      the very best of its kind, this has been owned with a
      recognition too wide and spontaneous to leave room for
      doubt. The brilliant, venturesome imagination, defying
      forecast with ever-fresh surprise; the sense of humour in
      its finest and most na&#239;ve form; the power to touch
      with lightest hand the undercurrent of pathos in the midst
      of fun; the audacity of creative fancy, and the delicacy of
      insight&mdash;these are rare gifts; and surely they were his.
      Yes, but it was his simplicity of mind and heart that
      raised them all, not only in his work but in his life, in
      all his ways, in the man as we knew him, to something
      higher than any mere enumeration of them tells: that almost
      curious simplicity, at times, that real and touching
      child-likeness that marked him in all fields of thought,
      appearing in his love of children and in their love of him,
      in his dread of giving pain to any living creature, in a
      certain disproportion, now and then, of the view he took of
      things&mdash;yes, and also in that deepest life, where the pure
      in heart and those who become as little children see the
      very truth and walk in the fear and love of God.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some extracts from the numerous sympathetic letters
      received by Mr. Dodgson's brothers and sisters will show
      how greatly his loss was felt. Thus Canon Jelf writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It was quite a shock to me to see in the paper to-day the
      death of your dear, good brother, to whom we owe so much of
      the brightening of our lives with pure, innocent fun.
      Personally I feel his loss very much indeed. We were
      together in old Ch. Ch. days from 1852 onwards; and he was
      always such a loyal, faithful friend to me. I rejoice to
      think of the <i>serious</i> talks we had together&mdash;of the
      grand, brave way in which he used the opportunities he had
      as a man of humour, to reach the consciences of a host of
      readers&mdash;of his love for children&mdash;his simplicity of heart&mdash;of
      his care for servants&mdash;his spiritual care for them. Who can
      doubt that he was fully prepared for a change however
      sudden&mdash;for the one clear call which took him away from us?
      Yet the world seems darker for his going; we can only get
      back our brightness by realising Who gave him all his
      talent, all his mirth of heart&mdash;the One who never leaves us.
      In deep sympathy,<br>
      <br>
      Yours very sincerely,<br>
      <br>
      George E. Jelf.<br>
      <br>
      P.S.&mdash;When you have time tell me a little about him; he was
      so dear to me.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Frederic Harrison writes as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The occasional visits that I received from your late
      brother showed me a side of his nature which to my mind was
      more interesting and more worthy of remembrance even than
      his wonderful and delightful humour&mdash;I mean his intense
      sympathy with all who suffer and are in need.<br>
      <br>
      He came to see me several times on sundry errands of mercy,
      and it has been a lesson to me through life to remember his
      zeal to help others in difficulty, his boundless
      generosity, and his inexhaustible patience with folly and
      error.<br>
      <br>
      My young daughter, like all young people in civilised
      countries, was brought up on his beautiful fancies and
      humours. But for my part I remember him mainly as a sort of
      missionary to all in need. We all alike grieve, and offer
      you our heartfelt sympathy.<br>
      <br>
      I am, faithfully yours,<br>
      <br>
      Frederic Harrison.

    <p>
      His old friend and tutor. Dr. Price, writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      ... I feel his removal from among us as the loss of an old
      and dear friend and pupil, to whom I have been most warmly
      attached ever since he was with me at Whitby, reading
      mathematics, in, I think, 1853&mdash;44 years ago! And 44 years
      of uninterrupted friendship .... I was pleased to read
      yesterday in <i>The Times</i> newspaper the kindly obituary
      notice: perfectly just and true; appreciative, as it should
      be, as to the unusual combination of deep mathematical
      ability and taste with the genius that led to the writing
      of "Alice's Adventures."<br>
      <br>
      Only the other day [writes a lady friend] he wrote to me
      about his admiration for my dear husband, and he ended his
      letter thus: "I trust that when <i>my</i> time comes, I may
      be found, like him, working to the last, and ready for the
      Master's call"&mdash;and truly so he was.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A friend at Oxford writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Mr. Dodgson was ever the kindest and gentlest of friends,
      bringing sunshine into the house with him. We shall mourn
      his loss deeply, and my two girls are quite overcome with
      grief. All day memories of countless acts of kindness shown
      to me, and to people I have known, have crowded my mind,
      and I feel it almost impossible to realise that he has
      passed beyond the reach of our gratitude and affection.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The following are extracts from letters written by some of
      his "child-friends," now grown up:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      How beautiful to think of the track of light and love he
      has left behind him, and the amount of happiness he brought
      into the lives of all those he came in contact with! I
      shall never forget all his kindness to us, from the time he
      first met us as little mites in the railway train, and one
      feels glad to have had the privilege of knowing him.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One of Mr. Dodgson's oldest "child-friends" writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      He was to me a dear and true friend, and it has been my
      great privilege to see a good deal of him ever since I was
      a tiny child, and especially during the last two years. I
      cannot tell you how much we shall miss him here. Ch. Ch.
      without Mr. Dodgson will be a strange place, and it is
      difficult to realise it even while we listen to the special
      solemn anthems and hymns to his memory in our cathedral.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One who had visited him at Guildford, writes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It must be quite sixteen years now since he first made
      friends with my sister and myself as children on the beach
      at Eastbourne, and since then his friendship has been and
      must always be one of my most valued possessions. It
      culminated, I think, in the summer of 1892&mdash;the year when he
      brought me to spend a very happy Sunday at Guildford. I had
      not seen him before, that year, for some time; and it was
      then, I think, that the childish delight in his kindness,
      and pride in his friendship, changed into higher love and
      reverence, when in our long walks over the downs I saw more
      and more into the great tenderness and gentleness of his
      nature.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Shortly after Mr. Dodgson's death, his "Three Sunsets" was
      published by Messrs. Macmillan. The twelve "Fairy Fancies,"
      which illustrate it, were drawn by Miss E. G. Thomson.
      Though they are entirely unconnected with the text, they
      are so thoroughly in accordance with the author's delicate
      refinement, and so beautiful in themselves, that they do
      not strike one as inappropriate.
    </p>

      Some of the verses are strangely in keeping with the time
      at which they are published.
    </p><span class="c6">I could not see, for blinding
    tears,</span><br>
    <span class="c11">The glories of the west:</span><br>
    <span class="c6">A heavenly music filled my ears,</span><br>
    <span class="c11">A heavenly peace my breast.</span><br>
    <span class="c6">"Come unto me, come unto me&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c6">All ye that labour, unto me&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Ye heavy-laden, come to me&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c11">And I will give you rest."</span><br>
    <p>
      One cannot read this little volume without feeling that the
      shadow of some disappointment lay over Lewis Carroll's
      life. Such I believe to have been the case, and it was this
      that gave him his wonderful sympathy with all who suffered.
      But those who loved him would not wish to lift the veil
      from these dead sanctities, nor would any purpose be served
      by so doing. The proper use of sympathy is not to weep over
      sorrows that are over, and whose very memory is perhaps
      obliterated for him in the first joy of possessing new and
      higher faculties.

    <p>
      Before leaving the subject of this book, I should like to
      draw attention to a few lines on "woman's mission," lines
      full of the noblest chivalry, reminding one of Tennyson's
      "Idylls of the King":&mdash;
    </p><span class="c11">In the darkest path of man's
    despair,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Where War and Terror shake the troubled
    earth,</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Lies woman's mission; with unblenching
    brow</span><br>
    <span class="c6">To pass through scenes of horror and
    affright</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Where men grow sick and tremble: unto
    her</span><br>
    <span class="c6">All things are sanctified, for all are
    good.</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her
    care:</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Nothing so great, but she may bear her
    part.</span><br>
    <span class="c6">No life is vain: each hath his place
    assigned:</span><br>
    <span class="c6">Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to
    God.</span><br>
    <p>
      Of the unpublished works which Mr. Dodgson left behind him,
      I may mention "Original Games and Puzzles"; "Symbolic
      Logic, Part ii.," and a portion of a mathematical book, the
      proofs of which are now in the hands of the Controller of
      the Oxford University Press.

      I will conclude this chapter with a poem which appeared in
      <i>Punch</i> for January 29th, a fortnight after Lewis
      Carroll's death. It expresses, with all the grace and
      insight of the true poet, what I have tried, so feebly and
      ineffectually, to say:&mdash;<br>
      <span class="c12">LEWIS CARROLL.</span><br>

    <p>
      This chapter, and the next will deal with Mr. Dodgson's
      friendships with children. It would have been impossible to
      arrange them in chronological sequence in the earlier part
      of this book, and the fact that they exhibit a very
      important and distinct side of his nature seems to justify
      me in assigning them a special and individual position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the contents of these two chapters, both my readers and
      myself owe a debt of gratitude to those child-friends of
      his, without whose ever-ready help this book could never
      have been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      From very early college days began to emerge that beautiful
      side of Lewis Carroll's character which afterwards was to
      be, next to his fame as an author, the one for which he was
      best known&mdash;his attitude towards children, and the strong
      attraction they had for him. I shall attempt to point out
      the various influences which led him in this direction; but
      if I were asked for one comprehensive word wide enough to
      explain this tendency of his nature, I would answer
      unhesitatingly&mdash;Love. My readers will remember a beautiful
      verse in "Sylvie and Bruno"; trite though it is, I cannot
      forbear to quote it&mdash;
    </p><span class="c1">Say, whose is the skill that paints
    valley and hill,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Like a picture so fair to the
    sight?</span><br>
    <span class="c1">That flecks the green meadow with sunshine
    and shadow,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Till the little lambs leap with
    delight?</span><br>
    <span class="c1">'Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and
    cold,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Though 'tis sung by the angels
    above,</span><br>
    <span class="c1">In notes that ring clear for the ears that
    can hear,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">And the name of the secret is
    Love!</span><br>
    <p>
      That "secret"&mdash;an open secret for him&mdash;explains this side of
      his character. As <i>he</i> read everything in its light,
      so it is only in its light that <i>we</i> can properly
      understand <i>him</i>. I think that the following quotation
      from a letter to the Rev. F. H. Atkinson, accompanying a
      copy of "Alice" for his little daughter Gertrude,
      sufficiently proves the truth of what I have just stated:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Many thanks to Mrs. Atkinson and to you for the sight of
      the tinted photograph of your Gertrude. As you say, the
      picture speaks for itself, and I can see exactly what sort
      of a child she is, in proof of which I send her my love and
      a kiss herewith. It is possible I may be the first (unseen)
      gentleman from whom she has had so ridiculous a message;
      but I can't say she is the first unseen child to whom I
      have sent one! I think the most precious message of the
      kind I ever got from a child I never saw (and never shall
      see in this world) was to the effect that she liked me when
      she read about Alice, "but please tell him, whenever I read
      that Easter letter he sent me I <i>do</i> love him!" She
      was in a hospital, and a lady friend who visited there had
      asked me to send the letter to her and some other sick
      children.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And now as to the secondary causes which attracted him to
      children. First, I think children appealed to him because
      he was pre-eminently a teacher, and he saw in their
      unspoiled minds the best material for him to work upon. In
      later years one of his favourite recreations was to lecture
      at schools on logic; he used to give personal attention to
      each of his pupils, and one can well imagine with what
      eager anticipation the children would have looked forward
      to the visits of a schoolmaster who knew how to make even
      the dullest subjects interesting and amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, children appealed to his &#230;sthetic faculties,
      for he was a keen admirer of the beautiful in every form.
      Poetry, music, the drama, all delighted him, but pictures
      more than all put together. I remember his once showing me
      "The Lady with the Lilacs," which Arthur Hughes had painted
      for him, and how he dwelt with intense pleasure on the
      exquisite contrasts of colour which it contained&mdash;the gold
      hair of a girl standing out against the purple of
      lilac-blossom. But with those who find in such things as
      these a complete satisfaction of their desire for the
      beautiful he had no sympathy; for no imperfect
      representations of life could, for him, take the place of
      life itself, life as God has made it&mdash;the babbling of the
      brook, the singing of the birds, the laughter and sweet
      faces of the children. And yet, recognising, as he did,
      what Mr. Pater aptly terms "the curious perfection of the
      human form," in man, as in nature, it was the soul that
      attracted him more than the body. His intense admiration,
      one might almost call it adoration, for the white innocence
      and uncontaminated spirituality of childhood emerges most
      clearly in "Sylvie and Bruno." He says very little of the
      personal beauty of his heroine; he might have asked, with
      Mr. Francis Thompson&mdash;
    </p><span class="c1">How can I tell what beauty is her
    dole,</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Who cannot see her countenance for her
    soul?</span><br>
    <p>
      So entirely occupied is he with her gentleness, her pity,
      her sincerity, and her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the reality of children appealed strongly to the
      simplicity and genuineness of his own nature. I believe
      that he understood children even better than he understood
      men and women; civilisation has made adult humanity very
      incomprehensible, for convention is as a veil which hides
      the divine spark that is in each of us, and so this strange
      thing has come to be, that the imperfect mirrors perfection
      more completely than the perfected, that we see more of God
      in the child than in the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in those moments of depression of which he had his full
      share, when old age seemed to mock him with all its
      futility and feebleness, it was the thought that the
      children still loved him which nerved him again to continue
      his life-work, which renewed his youth, so that to his
      friends he never seemed an old man. Even the hand of death
      itself only made his face look more boyish&mdash;the word is not
      too strong. "How wonderfully young your brother looks!"
      were the first words the doctor said, as he returned from
      the room where Lewis Carroll's body lay, to speak to the
      mourners below. And so he loved children because their
      friendship was the true source of his perennial youth and
      unflagging vigour. This idea is expressed in the following
      poem&mdash;an acrostic, which he wrote for a friend some twenty
      years ago:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c1">Around my lonely hearth,
    to-night,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Ghostlike the shadows wander:</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Now here, now there, a childish
    sprite,</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Earthborn and yet as angel
    bright,</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Seems near me as I ponder.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c1">Gaily she shouts: the laughing
    air</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Echoes her note of gladness&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Or bends herself with earnest
    care</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Round fairy-fortress to prepare</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Grim battlement or turret-stair&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c2">In childhood's merry madness!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c1">New raptures still hath youth in
    store:</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Age may but fondly cherish</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Half-faded memories of yore&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Up, craven heart! repine no more!</span><br>
    <span class="c1">Love stretches hands from shore to
    shore:</span><br>
    <span class="c2">Love is, and shall not perish!</span><br>
    <p>
      His first child-friend, so far as I know, was Miss Alice
      Liddell, the little companion whose innocent talk was one
      of the chief pleasures of his early life at Oxford, and to
      whom he told the tale that was to make him famous. In
      December, 1885, Miss M.E. Manners presented him with a
      little volume, of which she was the authoress, "Aunt Agatha
      Ann and Other Verses," and which contained a poem (which I
      quoted in Chapter VI.), about "Alice." Writing to
      acknowledge this gift, Lewis Carroll said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Permit me to offer you my sincere thanks for the very sweet
      verses you have written about my dream-child (named after a
      real Alice, but none the less a dream-child) and her
      Wonderland. That children love the book is a very precious
      thought to me, and, next to their love, I value the
      sympathy of those who come with a child's heart to what I
      have tried to write about a child's thoughts. Next to what
      conversing with an angel <i>might</i> be&mdash;for it is hard to
      imagine it&mdash;comes, I think, the privilege of having a real
      child's thoughts uttered to one. I have known some few
      <i>real</i> children (you have too, I am sure), and their
      friendship is a blessing and a help in life.

    <p>
      It is interesting to note how in "Sylvie and Bruno" his
      idea of the thoughts of a child has become deeper and more
      spiritual. Yet in the earlier tale, told "all in a golden
      afternoon," to the plash of oars and the swish of a boat
      through the waters of Cherwell or Thames, the ideal child
      is strangely beautiful; she has all Sylvie's genuineness
      and honesty, all her keen appreciation of the interest of
      life; only there lacks that mysterious charm of deep
      insight into the hidden forces of nature, the gentle power
      that makes the sky "such a darling blue," which almost
      links Sylvie with the angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of Lewis Carroll's early favourites was Miss
      Alexandra (Xie) Kitchin, daughter of the Dean of Durham.
      Her father was for fifteen years the Censor of the
      unattached members of the University of Oxford, so that Mr.
      Dodgson had plenty of opportunities of photographing his
      little friend, and it is only fair to him to say that he
      did not neglect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be futile to attempt even a bare list of the
      children whom he loved, and who loved him; during forty
      years of his life he was constantly adding to their number.
      Some remained friends for life, but in a large proportion
      of cases the friendship ended with the end of childhood. To
      one of those few, whose affection for him had not waned
      with increasing years, he wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I always feel specially grateful to friends who, like you,
      have given me a child-friendship and a woman&mdash;friendship.
      About nine out of ten, I think, of my child-friendships get
      ship-wrecked at the critical point, "where the stream and
      river meet," and the child-friends, once so affectionate,
      become uninteresting acquaintances, whom I have no wish to
      set eyes on again.

      These friendships usually began all very much in the same
      way. A chance meeting on the sea-shore, in the street, at
      some friend's house, led to conversation; then followed a
      call on the parents, and after that all sorts of kindnesses
      on Lewis Carroll's part, presents of books, invitations to
      stay with him at Oxford, or at Eastbourne, visits with him
      to the theatre. For the amusement of his little guests he
      kept a large assortment of musical-boxes, and an organette
      which had to be fed with paper tunes. On one occasion he
      ordered about twelve dozen of these tunes "on approval,"
      and asked one of the other dons, who was considered a judge
      of music, to come in and hear them played over. In addition
      to these attractions there were clock-work bears, mice, and
      frogs, and games and puzzles in infinite variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his little friends, Miss Isabel Standen, has sent me
      the following account of her first meeting with him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      We met for the first time in the Forbury Gardens, Reading.
      He was, I believe, waiting for a train. I was playing with
      my brothers and sisters in the Gardens. I remember his
      taking me on his knee and showing me puzzles, one of which
      he refers to in the letter (given below. This puzzle was,
      by the way, a great favourite of his; the problem is to
      draw three interlaced squares without going over the same
      lines twice, or taking the pen off the paper), which is so
      thoroughly characteristic of him in its quaint humour:&mdash;
      <blockquote>
        "The Chestnuts, Guildford,<br>
        <i>August</i> 22, 1869.<br>
        <br>
        My Dear Isabel,&mdash;Though I have only been acquainted with
        you for fifteen minutes, yet, as there is no one else in
        Reading I have known so long, I hope you will not mind my
        troubling you. Before I met you in the Gardens yesterday
        I bought some old books at a shop in Reading, which I
        left to be called for, and had not time to go back for
        them. I didn't even remark the name of the shop, but I
        can tell <i>where</i> it was, and if you know the name of
        the woman who keeps the shop, and would put it into the
        blank I have left in this note, and direct it to her I
        should be much obliged ... A friend of mine, called Mr.
        Lewis Carroll, tells me he means to send you a book. He
        is a <i>very</i> dear friend of mine. I have known him
        all my life (we are the same age) and have <i>never</i>
        left him. Of course he was with me in the Gardens, not a
        yard off&mdash;even while I was drawing those puzzles for you.
        I wonder if you saw him?<br>

      Another favourite puzzle was the following&mdash;I give it in his
      own words:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c1">A is to draw a fictitious map divided
    into counties.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c1">B is to colour it (or rather mark the
    counties with <i>names</i> of</span><br>
    <span class="c1">colours) using as few colours as
    possible.</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c1">Two adjacent counties must have

    <span class="c1">How many can he force B to use?</span><br>
    <p>
      One of his most amusing letters was to a little girl called
      Magdalen, to whom he had given a copy of his "Hunting of
      the Snark":&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Christ Church,<br>
      <i>December</i> 15, 1875.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Magdalen,&mdash;I want to explain to you why I did not
      call yesterday. I was sorry to miss you, but you see I had
      so many conversations on the way. I tried to explain to the
      people in the street that I was going to see you, but they
      wouldn't listen; they said they were in a hurry, which was
      rude. At last I met a wheelbarrow that I thought would
      attend to me, but I couldn't make out what was in it. I saw
      some features at first, then I looked through a telescope,
      and found it was a countenance; then I looked through a
      microscope, and found it was a face! I thought it was
      father like me, so I fetched a large looking-glass to make
      sure, and then to my great joy I found it was me. We shook
      hands, and were just beginning to talk, when myself came up
      and joined us, and we had quite a pleasant conversation. I
      said, "Do you remember when we all met at Sandown?" and
      myself said, "It was very jolly there; there was a child
      called Magdalen," and me said, "I used to like her a
      little; not much, you know&mdash;only a little." Then it was time
      for us to go to the train, and who do you think came to the
      station to see us off? You would never guess, so I must
      tell you. They were two very dear friends of mine, who
      happen to be here just now, and beg to be allowed to sign
      this letter as your affectionate friends,<br>
      <br>
      Lewis Carroll and C.L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Another child-friend, Miss F. Bremer, writes as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Our acquaintance began in a somewhat singular manner. We
      were playing on the Fort at Margate, and a gentleman on a
      seat near asked us if we could make a paper boat, with a
      seat at each end, and a basket in the middle for fish! We
      were, of course, enchanted with the idea, and our new
      friend&mdash;after achieving the feat&mdash;gave us his card, which we
      at once carried to our mother. He asked if he might call
      where we were staying, and then presented my elder sister
      with a copy of "Alice in Wonderland," inscribed "From the
      Author." He kindly organised many little excursions for
      us&mdash;chiefly in the pursuit of knowledge. One memorable visit
      to a light house is still fresh in our memories.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was while calling one day upon Mrs. Bremer that he
      scribbled off the following double acrostic on the names of
      her two daughters&mdash;
    </p>
    <pre>      <tt>
        DOUBLE ACROSTIC&mdash;FIVE LETTERS.

        Two little girls near London dwell,
        More naughty than I like to tell.

                         1.
        Upon the lawn the hoops are seen:
        The balls are rolling on the green.       T  ur  F

                         2.
        The Thames is running deep and wide:
        And boats are rowing on the tide.         R ive  R

                         3.
        In winter-time, all in a row,
        The happy skaters come and go.            I  c   E

                         4.
        "Papa!" they cry, "Do let us stay!"
        He does not speak, but says they may.     N   o  D

                         5.
        "There is a land," he says, "my dear,
        Which is too hot to skate, I fear."       A fric A
</tt>      <br></pre>
    <p>
      At Margate also he met Miss Adelaide Paine, who afterwards
      became one of his greatest favourites. He could not bear to
      see the healthy pleasures of childhood spoiled by
      conventional restraint. "One piece of advice given to my
      parents," writes Miss Paine, "gave me very great glee, and
      that was not to make little girls wear gloves at the
      seaside; they took the advice, and I enjoyed the result."
      <i>Apropos</i> of this I may mention that, when staying at
      Eastbourne, he never went down to the beach without
      providing himself with a supply of safety-pins. Then if he
      saw any little girl who wanted to wade in the sea, but was
      afraid of spoiling her frock, he would gravely go up to her
      and present her with a safety-pin, so that she might fasten
      up her skirts out of harm's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tight boots were a great aversion of his, especially for
      children. One little girl who was staying with him at
      Eastbourne had occasion to buy a new pair of boots. Lewis
      Carroll gave instructions to the bootmaker as to how they
      were to be made, so as to be thoroughly comfortable, with
      the result that when they came home they were more useful
      than ornamental, being very nearly as broad as they were
      long! Which shows that even hygienic principles may be
      pushed too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first meeting with Miss Paine took place in 1876. When
      Lewis Carroll returned to Christ Church he sent her a copy
      of "The Hunting of the Snark," with the following acrostic
      written in the fly-leaf:&mdash;
    </p>
    <pre>      <tt>
'A re you deaf, Father William?' the young man said,
'D id you hear what I told you just now?
 E xcuse me for shouting! Don't waggle your head
 L ike a blundering, sleepy old cow!
 A little maid dwelling in Wallington Town,
 I s my friend, so I beg to remark:
 D o you think she'd be pleased if a book were sent down
 E ntitled "The Hunt of the Snark?"'

'P ack it up in brown paper!' the old man cried,
'A nd seal it with olive-and-dove.
 I command you to do it!' he added with pride,
'N or forget, my good fellow, to send her beside
 E aster Greetings, and give her my love.'
</tt>      <br></pre>
    <p>
      This was followed by a letter, dated June 7, 1876:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Adelaide,&mdash;Did you try if the letters at the
      beginnings of the lines about Father William would spell
      anything? Sometimes it happens that you can spell out words
      that way, which is very curious.<br>
      <br>
      I wish you could have heard him when he shouted out "Pack
      it up in brown paper!" It quite shook the house. And he
      threw one of his shoes at his son's head (just to make him
      attend, you know), but it missed him.<br>
      <br>
      He was glad to hear you had got the book safe, but his eyes
      filled with tears as he said, "I sent <i>her</i> my love,
      but she never&mdash;" he couldn't say any more, his mouth was so
      full of bones (he was just finishing a roast goose).
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Another letter to Miss Paine is very characteristic of his
      quaint humour:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Christ Church, Oxford,<br>
      <i>March</i> 8, 1880.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Ada,&mdash;(Isn't that your short name? "Adelaide" is all
      very well, but you see when one's <i>dreadfully</i> busy
      one hasn't time to write such long words&mdash;particularly when
      it takes one half an hour to remember how to spell it&mdash;and
      even then one has to go and get a dictionary to see if one
      has spelt it right, and of course the dictionary is in
      another room, at the top of a high bookcase&mdash;where it has
      been for months and months, and has got all covered with
      dust&mdash;so one has to get a duster first of all, and nearly
      choke oneself in dusting it&mdash;and when one <i>has</i> made
      out at last which is dictionary and which is dust, even
      <i>then</i> there's the job of remembering which end of the
      alphabet "A" comes&mdash;for one feels pretty certain it isn't in
      the <i>middle</i>&mdash;then one has to go and wash one's hands
      before turning over the leaves&mdash;for they've got so thick
      with dust one hardly knows them by sight&mdash;and, as likely as
      not, the soap is lost, and the jug is empty, and there's no
      towel, and one has to spend hours and hours in finding
      things&mdash;and perhaps after all one has to go off to the shop
      to buy a new cake of soap&mdash;so, with all this bother, I hope
      you won't mind my writing it short and saying, "My dear
      Ada"). You said in your last letter you would like a
      likeness of me: so here it is, and I hope you will like
      it&mdash;I won't forget to call the next time but one I'm in
      Wallington.<br>
      <br>
      Your very affectionate friend,<br>
      <br>
      Lewis Carroll.

    <p>
      It was quite against Mr. Dodgson's usual rule to give away
      photographs of himself; he hated publicity, and the above
      letter was accompanied by another to Mrs. Paine, which ran
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I am very unwilling, usually, to give my photograph, for I
      don't want people, who have heard of Lewis Carroll, to be
      able to recognise him in the street&mdash;but I can't refuse Ada.
      Will you kindly take care, if any of your ordinary
      acquaintances (I don't speak of intimate friends) see it,
      that they are <i>not</i> told anything about the name of
      "Lewis Carroll"?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He even objected to having his books discussed in his
      presence; thus he writes to a friend:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Your friend, Miss&mdash;was very kind and complimentary about my
      books, but may I confess that I would rather have them
      ignored? Perhaps I am too fanciful, but I have somehow
      taken a dislike to being talked to about them; and
      consequently have some trials to bear in society, which
      otherwise would be no trials at all.... I don't think any
      of my many little stage-friends have any shyness at all
      about being talked to of their performances. <i>They</i>
      thoroughly enjoy the publicity that I shrink from.

      The child to whom the three following letters were
      addressed, Miss Gaynor Simpson, was one of Lewis Carroll's
      Guildford friends. The correct answer to the riddle
      propounded in the second letter is "Copal":&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>December</i> 27, 1873.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Gaynor,&mdash;My name is spelt with a "G," that is to say
      "<i>Dodgson</i> ." Any one who spells it the same as that
      wretch (I mean of course the Chairman of Committees in the
      House of Commons) offends me <i>deeply</i> , and <i>for
      ever!</i> It is a thing I <i>can</i> forget, but <i>never
      can forgive!</i> If you do it again, I shall call you
      "'aynor." Could you live happy with such a name?<br>

      As to dancing, my dear, I <i>never</i> dance, unless I am
      allowed to do it <i>in my own peculiar way.</i> There is no
      use trying to describe it: it has to be seen to be
      believed. The last house I tried it in, the floor broke
      through. But then it was a poor sort of floor&mdash;the beams
      were only six inches thick, hardly worth calling beams at
      all: stone arches are much more sensible, when any dancing,
      <i>of my peculiar kind</i>, is to be done. Did you ever see
      the Rhinoceros, and the Hippopotamus, at the
      Zo&#246;logical Gardens, trying to dance a minuet together?

      Lewis Carroll during the last fifteen years of his life
      always spent the Long Vacation at Eastbourne; in earlier
      times, Sandown, a pleasant little seaside resort in the
      Isle of Wight, was his summer abode. He loved the sea both
      for its own sake and because of the number of children whom
      he met at seaside places. Here is another "first meeting";
      this time it is at Sandown, and Miss Gertrude Chataway is
      the narrator:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I first met Mr. Lewis Carroll on the sea-shore at Sandown
      in the Isle of Wight, in the summer of 1875, when I was
      quite a little child.<br>
      <br>
      We had all been taken there for change of air, and next
      door there was an old gentlemen&mdash;to me at any rate he seemed
      old&mdash;who interested me immensely. He would come on to his
      balcony, which joined ours, sniffing the sea-air with his
      head thrown back, and would walk right down the steps on to
      the beach with his chin in air, drinking in the fresh
      breezes as if he could never have enough. I do not know why
      this excited such keen curiosity on my part, but I remember
      well that whenever I heard his footstep I flew out to see
      him coming, and when one day he spoke to me my joy was
      complete.<br>
      <br>
      Thus we made friends, and in a very little while I was as
      familiar with the interior of his lodgings as with our
      own.<br>
      <br>
      I had the usual child's love for fairy-tales and marvels,
      and his power of telling stories naturally fascinated me.
      We used to sit for hours on the wooden steps which led from
      our garden on to the beach, whilst he told the most lovely
      tales that could possibly be imagined, often illustrating
      the exciting situations with a pencil as he went along.<br>
      <br>
      One thing that made his stories particularly charming to a
      child was that he often took his cue from her remarks&mdash;a
      question would set him off on quite a new trail of ideas,
      so that one felt that one had somehow helped to make the
      story, and it seemed a personal possession It was the most
      lovely nonsense conceivable, and I naturally revelled in
      it. His vivid imagination would fly from one subject to
      another, and was never tied down in any way by the
      probabilities of life.<br>
      <br>
      To <i>me</i> it was of course all perfect, but it is
      astonishing that <i>he</i> never seemed either tired or to
      want other society. I spoke to him once of this since I
      have been grown up, and he told me it was the greatest
      pleasure he could have to converse freely with a child, and
      feel the depths of her mind.<br>
      <br>
      He used to write to me and I to him after that summer, and
      the friendship, thus begun, lasted. His letters were one of
      the greatest joys of my childhood.<br>
      <br>
      I don't think that he ever really understood that we, whom
      he had known as children, could not always remain such. I
      stayed with him only a few years ago, at Eastbourne, and
      felt for the time that I was once more a child. He never
      appeared to realise that I had grown up, except when I
      reminded him of the fact, and then he only said, "Never
      mind: you will always be a child to me, even when your hair
      is grey."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some of the letters, to which Miss Chataway refers in these
      reminiscences, I am enabled, through her kindness, to give
      below:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Christ Church, Oxford,<br>
      <i>October</i> 13, 1875.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;I never give birthday <i>presents</i>,
      but you see I <i>do</i> sometimes write a birthday
      <i>letter</i> : so, as I've just arrived here, I am writing
      this to wish you many and many a happy return of your
      birthday to-morrow. I will drink your health, if only I can
      remember, and if you don't mind&mdash;but perhaps you object? You
      see, if I were to sit by you at breakfast, and to drink
      your tea, you wouldn't like <i>that</i>, would you? You
      would say "Boo! hoo! Here's Mr. Dodgson's drunk all my tea,
      and I haven't got any left!" So I am very much afraid, next
      time Sybil looks for you, she'll find you sitting by the
      sad sea-wave, and crying "Boo! hoo! Here's Mr. Dodgson has
      drunk my health, and I haven't got any left!" And how it
      will puzzle Dr. Maund, when he is sent for to see you! "My
      dear Madam, I'm very sorry to say your little girl has got
      <i>no health at all</i>! I never saw such a thing in my
      life!" "Oh, I can easily explain it!" your mother will say.
      "You see she would go and make friends with a strange
      gentleman, and yesterday he drank her health!" "Well, Mrs.
      Chataway," he will say, "the only way to cure her is to
      wait till his next birthday, and then for <i>her</i> to
      drink <i>his</i> health."<br>
      <br>
      And then we shall have changed healths. I wonder how you'll
      like mine! Oh, Gertrude, I wish you wouldn't talk such
      nonsense!...<br>

      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;This really will <i>not</i> do, you know,
      sending one more kiss every time by post: the parcel gets
      so heavy it is quite expensive. When the postman brought in
      the last letter, he looked quite grave. "Two pounds to pay,
      sir!" he said. "<i>Extra weight</i>, sir!" (I think he
      cheats a little, by the way. He often makes me pay two
      <i>pounds</i> , when I think it should be <i>pence</i>).
      "Oh, if you please, Mr. Postman!" I said, going down
      gracefully on one knee (I wish you could see me go down on
      one knee to a postman&mdash;it's a very pretty sight), "do excuse
      me just this once! It's only from a little girl!"<br>
      <br>
      "Only from a little girl!" he growled. "What are little
      girls made of?" "Sugar and spice," I began to say, "and all
      that's ni&mdash;" but he interrupted me. "No! I don't mean
      <i>that</i>. I mean, what's the good of little girls, when
      they send such heavy letters?" "Well, they're not
      <i>much</i> good, certainly," I said, rather sadly.<br>
      <br>
      "Mind you don't get any more such letters," he said, "at
      least, not from that particular little girl. <i>I know her
      well, and she's a regular bad one</i>!" That's not true,
      is it? I don't believe he ever saw you, and you're not a
      bad one, are you? However, I promised him we would send
      each other <i>very</i> few more letters&mdash;"Only two thousand
      four hundred and seventy, or so," I said. "Oh!" he said, "a
      little number like <i>that</i> doesn't signify. What I
      meant is, you mustn't send <i>many</i> ."<br>
      <br>
      So you see we must keep count now, and when we get to two
      thousand four hundred and seventy, we mustn't write any
      more, unless the postman gives us leave.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;Explain to me how I am to enjoy Sandown
      without <i>you</i> . How can I walk on the beach alone? How
      can I sit all alone on those wooden steps? So you see, as I
      shan't be able to do without you, you will have to come. If
      Violet comes, I shall tell her to invite you to stay with
      her, and then I shall come over in the Heather-Bell and
      fetch you.<br>
      <br>
      If I ever <i>do</i> come over, I see I couldn't go back the
      same day, so you will have to engage me a bed somewhere in
      Swanage; and if you can't find one, I shall expect
      <i>you</i> to spend the night on the beach, and give up
      your room to <i>me</i>. Guests of course must be thought of
      before children; and I'm sure in these warm nights the
      beach will be quite good enough for <i>you</i>. If you
      <i>did</i> feel a little chilly, of course you could go
      into a bathing-machine, which everybody knows is
      <i>very</i> comfortable to sleep in&mdash;you know they make the
      floor of soft wood on purpose. I send you seven kisses (to
      last a week) and remain<br>

      My dearest Gertrude,&mdash;You will be sorry, and surprised, and
      puzzled, to hear what a queer illness I have had ever since
      you went. I sent for the doctor, and said, "Give me some
      medicine, for I'm tired." He said, "Nonsense and stuff! You
      don't want medicine: go to bed!" I said, "No; it isn't the
      sort of tiredness that wants bed. I'm tired in the
      <i>face</i>." He looked a little grave, and said, "Oh, it's
      your <i>nose</i> that's tired: a person often talks too
      much when he thinks he nose a great deal." I said, "No; it
      isn't the nose. Perhaps it's the <i>hair</i>." Then he
      looked rather grave, and said, "<i>Now</i> I understand:
      you've been playing too many hairs on the piano-forte."
      "No, indeed I haven't!" I said, "and it isn't exactly the
      <i>hair</i>: it's more about the nose and chin." Then he
      looked a good deal graver, and said, "Have you been walking
      much on your chin lately?" I said, "No." "Well!" he said,
      "it puzzles me very much. Do you think that it's in the
      lips?" "Of course!" I said. "That's exactly what it is!"
      Then he looked very grave indeed, and said, "I think you
      must have been giving too many kisses." "Well," I said, "I
      did give <i>one</i> kiss to a baby child, a little friend
      of mine." "Think again," he said; "are you sure it was only
      <i>one</i>?" I thought again, and said, "Perhaps it was
      eleven times." Then the doctor said, "You must not give her
      <i>any</i> more till your lips are quite rested again."
      "But what am I to do?" I said, "because you see, I owe her
      a hundred and eighty-two more." Then he looked so grave
      that the tears ran down his cheeks, and he said, "You may
      send them to her in a box." Then I remembered a little box
      that I once bought at Dover, and thought I would some day
      give it to <i>some</i> little girl or other. So I have
      packed them all in it very carefully. Tell me if they come
      safe, or if any are lost on the way.<br>

      Reading Station,<br>
      <i>April</i> 13, 1878.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;As I have to wait here for half an hour,
      I have been studying Bradshaw (most things, you know, ought
      to be studied: even a trunk is studded with nails), and the
      result is that it seems I could come, any day next week, to
      Winckfield, so as to arrive there about one; and that, by
      leaving Winckfield again about half-past six, I could reach
      Guildford again for dinner. The next question is, <i>How
      far is it from Winckfield to Rotherwick</i>? Now do not
      deceive me, you wretched child! If it is more than a
      hundred miles, I can't come to see you, and there is no use
      to talk about it. If it is less, the next question is,
      <i>How much less?</i> These are serious questions, and you
      must be as serious as a judge in answering them. There
      mustn't be a smile in your pen, or a wink in your ink
      (perhaps you'll say, "There can't be a <i>wink</i> in
      <i>ink</i>: but there <i>may</i> be <i>ink</i> in a
      <i>wink</i>"&mdash;but this is trifling; you mustn't make jokes
      like that when I tell you to be serious) while you write to
      Guildford and answer these two questions. You might as well
      tell me at the same time whether you are still living at
      Rotherwick&mdash;and whether you are at home&mdash;and whether you get
      my letter&mdash;and whether you're still a child, or a grown-up
      person&mdash;and whether you're going to the seaside next
      summer&mdash;and anything else (except the alphabet and the
      multiplication table) that you happen to know. I send you
      10,000,000 kisses, and remain.<br>

      The Chestnuts, Guildford,<br>
      <i>April</i> 19, 1878.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;I'm afraid it's "no go"&mdash;I've had such a
      bad cold all the week that I've hardly been out for some
      days, and I don't think it would be wise to try the
      expedition this time, and I leave here on Tuesday. But
      after all, what does it signify? Perhaps there are ten or
      twenty gentlemen, all living within a few miles of
      Rotherwick, and any one of them would do just as well! When
      a little girl is hoping to take a plum off a dish, and
      finds that she can't have that one, because it's bad or
      unripe, what does she do? Is she sorry, or disappointed?
      Not a bit! She just takes another instead, and grins from
      one little ear to the other as she puts it to her lips!
      This is a little fable to do you good; the little girl
      means <i>you</i>&mdash;the bad plum means <i>me</i>&mdash;the other
      plum means some other friend&mdash;and all that about the little
      girl putting plums to her lips means&mdash;well, it means&mdash;but you
      know you can't expect <i>every bit</i> of a fable to mean
      something! And the little girl grinning means that dear
      little smile of yours, that just reaches from the tip of
      one ear to the tip of the other!<br>

      The next letter is a good example of the dainty little

    <p>
      Only a few years ago, illness prevented him from fulfilling
      his usual custom of spending Christmas with his sisters at
      Guildford. This is the allusion in the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear old Friend,&mdash;(The friendship is old, though the
      child is young.) I wish a very happy New Year, and many of
      them, to you and yours; but specially to you, because I
      know you best and love you most. And I pray God to bless
      you, dear child, in this bright New Year, and many a year
      to come. ... I write all this from my sofa, where I have
      been confined a prisoner for six weeks, and as I dreaded
      the railway journey, my doctor and I agreed that I had
      better not go to spend Christmas with my sisters at
      Guildford. So I had my Christmas dinner all alone, in my
      room here, and (pity me, Gertrude!) it wasn't a Christmas
      dinner at all&mdash;I suppose the cook thought I should not care
      for roast beef or plum pudding, so he sent me (he has
      general orders to send either fish and meat, or meat and
      pudding) some fried sole and some roast mutton! Never,
      never have I dined before, on Christmas Day, without
      <i>plum pudding</i>. Wasn't it sad? Now I think you must be
      content; this is a longer letter than most will get. Love
      to Olive. My clearest memory of her is of a little girl
      calling out "Good-night" from her room, and of your mother
      taking me in to see her in her bed, and wish her
      good-night. I have a yet clearer memory (like a dream of
      fifty years ago) of a little bare-legged girl in a sailor's
      jersey, who used to run up into my lodgings by the sea. But
      why should I trouble you with foolish reminiscences of
      <i>mine</i> that <i>cannot</i> interest you?<br>
      <br>
      Yours always lovingly,<br>
      <br>
      C. L. Dodgson.

    <p>
      It was a writer in <i>The National Review</i> who, after
      eulogising the talents of Lewis Carroll, and stating that
      <i>he</i> would never be forgotten, added the harsh
      prophecy that "future generations will not waste a single
      thought upon the Rev. C.L. Dodgson."
    </p>
    <p>
      If this prediction is destined to be fulfilled, I think my
      readers will agree with me that it will be solely on
      account of his extraordinary diffidence about asserting
      himself. But such an unnatural division of Lewis Carroll,
      the author, from the Rev. C.L. Dodgson, the man, is forced
      in the extreme. His books are simply the expression of his
      normal habit of mind, as these letters show. In literature,
      as in everything else, he was absolutely natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      To refer to such criticisms as this (I am thankful to say
      they have been very few) is not agreeable; but I feel that
      it is owing to Mr. Dodgson to do what I can to vindicate
      the real unity which underlay both his life and all his
      writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of many anecdotes which might be adduced to show the
      lovable character of the man, the following little story
      has reached me through one of his child-friends:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My sister and I [she writes] were spending a day of
      delightful sightseeing in town with him, on our way to his
      home at Guildford, where we were going to pass a day or two
      with him. We were both children, and were much interested
      when he took us into an American shop where the cakes for
      sale were cooked by a very rapid process before your eyes,
      and handed to you straight from the cook's hands. As the
      preparation of them could easily be seen from outside the
      window, a small crowd of little ragamuffins naturally
      assembled there, and I well remember his piling up seven of
      the cakes on one arm, and himself taking them out and
      doling them round to the seven hungry little youngsters.
      The simple kindness of his act impressed its charm on his
      child-friends inside the shop as much as on his little
      stranger friends outside.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was only to those who had but few personal dealings with
      him that he seemed stiff and "donnish"; to his more
      intimate acquaintances, who really understood him, each
      little eccentricity of manner or of habits was a delightful
      addition to his charming and interesting personality. That
      he was, in some respects, eccentric cannot be denied; for
      instance he hardly ever wore an overcoat, and always wore a
      tall hat, whatever might be the climatic conditions. At
      dinner in his rooms small pieces of cardboard took the
      place of table-mats; they answered the purpose perfectly
      well, he said, and to buy anything else would be a mere
      waste of money. On the other hand, when purchasing books
      for himself, or giving treats to the children he loved, he
      never seemed to consider expense at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He very seldom sat down to write, preferring to stand while
      thus engaged. When making tea for his friends, he used, in
      order, I suppose, to expedite the process, to walk up and
      down the room waving the teapot about, and telling
      meanwhile those delightful anecdotes of which he had an
      inexhaustible supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great were his preparations before going a journey; each
      separate article used to be carefully wrapped up in a piece
      of paper all to itself, so that his trunks contained nearly
      as much paper as of the more useful things. The bulk of the
      luggage was sent on a day or two before by goods train,
      while he himself followed on the appointed day, laden only
      with his well-known little black bag, which he always
      insisted on carrying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a strong objection to staring colours in dress, his
      favourite combination being pink and grey. One little girl
      who came to stay with him was absolutely forbidden to wear
      a red frock, of a somewhat pronounced hue, while out in his
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      At meals he was very abstemious always, while he took
      nothing in the middle of the day except a glass of wine and
      a biscuit. Under these circumstances it is not very
      surprising that the healthy appetites of his little friends
      filled him with wonder, and even with alarm. When he took a
      certain one of them out with him to a friend's house to
      dinner, he used to give the host or hostess a gentle
      warning, to the mixed amazement and indignation of the
      child, "Please be careful, because she eats a good deal too
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another peculiarity, which I have already referred to, was
      his objection to being invited to dinners or any other
      social gatherings; he made a rule of never accepting
      invitations. "Because you have invited me, therefore I
      cannot come," was the usual form of his refusal. I suppose
      the reason of this was his hatred of the interference with
      work which engagements of this sort occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an extreme horror of infection, as will appear from
      the following illustration. Miss Isa Bowman and her sister,
      Nellie, were at one time staying with him at Eastbourne,
      when news came from home that their youngest sister had
      caught the scarlet fever. From that day every letter which
      came from Mrs. Bowman to the children was held up by Mr.
      Dodgson, while the two little girls, standing at the
      opposite end of the room, had to read it as best they
      could. Mr. Dodgson, who was the soul of honour, used always
      to turn his head to one side during these readings, lest he
      might inadvertently see some words that were not meant for
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some extracts from letters of his to a child-friend, who
      prefers to remain anonymous, follow:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>November</i> 30, 1879.<br>
      <br>
      I have been awfully busy, and I've had to write
      <i>heaps</i> of letters&mdash;wheelbarrows full, almost. And it
      tires me so that generally I go to bed again the next
      minute after I get up: and sometimes I go to bed again a
      minute <i>before</i> I get up! Did you ever hear of any one
      being so tired as <i>that?</i> ...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>November</i> 7, 1882.<br>
      <br>
      My dear E&mdash;, How often you must find yourself in want of a
      pin! For instance, you go into a shop, and you say to the
      man, "I want the largest penny bun you can let me have for
      a halfpenny." And perhaps the man looks stupid, and doesn't
      quite understand what you mean. Then how convenient it is
      to have a pin ready to stick into the back of his hand,
      while you say, "Now then! Look sharp, stupid!"... and even
      when you don't happen to want a pin, how often you think to
      yourself, "They say Interlacken is a very pretty place. I
      wonder what it looks like!" (That is the place that is
      painted on this pincushion.)<br>
      <br>
      When you don't happen to want either a pin or pictures, it
      may just remind you of a friend who sometimes thinks of his
      dear little friend E&mdash;, and who is just now thinking of the
      day he met her on the parade, the first time she had been
      allowed to come out alone to look for him....<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>December</i> 26, 1886.<br>
      <br>
      My dear E&mdash;, Though rushing, rapid rivers roar between us
      (if you refer to the map of England, I think you'll find
      that to be correct), we still remember each other, and feel
      a sort of shivery affection for each other....<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>March</i> 31, 1890.<br>
      <br>
      I <i>do</i> sympathise so heartily with you in what you say
      about feeling shy with children when you have to entertain
      them! Sometimes they are a real <i>terror</i> to
      me&mdash;especially boys: little girls I can now and then get on
      with, when they're few enough. They easily become "de
      trop." But with little <i>boys</i> I'm out of my element
      altogether. I sent "Sylvie and Bruno" to an Oxford friend,
      and, in writing his thanks, he added, "I think I must bring
      my little boy to see you." So I wrote to say
      "<i>don't</i>," or words to that effect: and he wrote again
      that he could hardly believe his eyes when he got my note.
      He thought I doted on <i>all</i> children. But I'm
      <i>not</i> omnivorous!&mdash;like a pig. I pick and
      choose....<br>
      <br>
      You are a lucky girl, and I am rather inclined to envy you,
      in having the leisure to read Dante&mdash;<i>I</i> have never
      read a page of him; yet I am sure the "Divina Commedia" is
      one of the grandest books in the world&mdash;though I am
      <i>not</i> sure whether the reading of it would
      <i>raise</i> one's life and give it a nobler purpose, or
      simply be a grand poetical treat. That is a question you
      are beginning to be able to answer: I doubt if <i>I</i>
      shall ever (at least in this life) have the opportunity of
      reading it; my life seems to be all torn into little bits
      among the host of things I want to do! It seems hard to
      settle what to do <i>first. One</i> piece of work, at any
      rate, I am clear ought to be done this year, and it will
      take months of hard work: I mean the second volume of
      "Sylvie and Bruno." I fully <i>mean</i> , if I have life
      and health till Xmas next, to bring it out then. When one
      is close on sixty years old, it seems presumptuous to count
      on years and years of work yet to be done....<br>
      <br>
      She is rather the exception among the hundred or so of
      child-friends who have brightened my life. Usually the
      child becomes so entirely a different being as she grows
      into a woman, that our friendship has to change too: and
      <i>that</i> it usually does by gliding down from a loving
      intimacy into an acquaintance that merely consists of a
      smile and a bow when we meet!...<br>

      ... You are quite correct in saying it is a long time since
      you have heard from me: in fact, I find that I have not
      written to you since the 13th of last November. But what of
      that? You have access to the daily papers. Surely you can
      find out negatively, that I am all right! Go carefully
      through the list of bankruptcies; then run your eye down
      the police cases; and, if you fail to find my name
      anywhere, you can say to your mother in a tone of calm
      satisfaction, "Mr. Dodgson is going on <i>well</i>."

      Lewis Carroll's own position as an author did not prevent
      him from taking a great interest in children's books and
      their writers. He had very strong ideas on what was or was
      not suitable in such books, but, when once his somewhat
      exacting taste was satisfied, he was never tired of
      recommending a story to his friends. His cousin, Mrs.
      Egerton Allen, who has herself written several charming
      tales for young readers, has sent me the following letter
      which she received from him some years ago:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Georgie,&mdash;<i>Many</i> thanks. The book was at Ch. Ch.
      I've done an unusual thing, in thanking for a book, namely,
      <i>waited to read it</i>. I've read it <i>right
      through</i>! In fact, I found it very refreshing, when
      jaded with my own work at "Sylvie and Bruno" (coming out at
      Xmas, I hope) to lie down on the sofa and read a chapter of
      "Evie." I like it very much: and am so glad to have helped
      to bring it out. It would have been a real loss to the
      children of England, if you had burned the MS., as you once
      thought of doing....

      The very last words of his that appeared in print took the
      form of a preface to one of Mrs. Allen's tales, "The Lost
      Plum-Cake," (Macmillan &amp; Co., 1898). So far as I know,
      this was the only occasion on which he wrote a preface for
      another author's book, and his remarks are doubly
      interesting as being his last service to the children whom
      he loved. No apology, then, is needed for quoting from them
      here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Let me seize this opportunity of saying one earnest word to
      the mothers in whose hands this little book may chance to
      come, who are in the habit of taking their children to
      church with them. However well and reverently those dear
      little ones have been taught to behave, there is no doubt
      that so long a period of enforced quietude is a severe tax
      on their patience. The hymns, perhaps, tax it least: and
      what a pathetic beauty there is in the sweet fresh voices
      of the children, and how earnestly they sing! I took a
      little girl of six to church with me one day: they had told
      me she could hardly read at all&mdash;but she made me find all
      the places for her! And afterwards I said to her elder
      sister "What made you say Barbara couldn't read? Why, I
      heard her joining in, all through the hymn!" And the little
      sister gravely replied, "She knows the <i>tunes</i>, but
      not the <i>words</i>." Well, to return to my
      subject&mdash;children in church. The lessons, and the prayers,
      are not wholly beyond them: often they can catch little
      bits that come within the range of their small minds. But
      the sermons! It goes to one's heart to see, as I so often
      do, little darlings of five or six years old, forced to sit
      still through a weary half-hour, with nothing to do, and
      not one word of the sermon that they can understand. Most
      heartily can I sympathise with the little charity-girl who
      is said to have written to some friend, "I think, when I
      grows up, I'll never go to church no more. I think I'se
      getting sermons enough to last me all my life!" But need it
      be so? Would it be so <i>very</i> irreverent to let your
      child have a story&mdash;book to read during the sermon, to while
      away that tedious half-hour, and to make church&mdash;going a
      bright and happy memory, instead of rousing the thought,
      "I'll never go to church no more"? I think not. For my
      part, I should love to see the experiment tried. I am quite
      sure it would be a success. My advice would be to
      <i>keep</i> some books for that special purpose. I would
      call such books "Sunday-treats"&mdash;and your little boy or girl
      would soon learn to look forward with eager hope to that
      half-hour, once so tedious. If I were the preacher, dealing
      with some subject too hard for the little ones, I should
      love to see them all enjoying their picture-books. And if
      <i>this</i> little book should ever come to be used as a
      "Sunday-treat" for some sweet baby reader, I don't think it
      could serve a better purpose.<br>

      Miss M.E. Manners was another writer for children whose
      books pleased him. She gives an amusing account of two
      visits which he paid to her house in 1889:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>An Unexpected Guest.</i><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      "Mr. Dobson wants to see you, miss."<br>
      <br>
      I was in the kitchen looking after the dinner, and did not
      feel that I particularly wished to see anybody.<br>
      <br>
      "He wants a vote, or he is an agent for a special kind of
      tea," thought I. "I don't know him; ask him to send a
      message."<br>
      <br>
      Presently the maid returned&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      "He says he is Mr. Dodgson, of Oxford."<br>
      <br>
      "Lewis Carroll!" I exclaimed; and somebody else had to
      superintend the cooking that day.<br>
      <br>
      My apologies were soon made and cheerfully accepted. I
      believe I was unconventional enough to tell the exact truth
      concerning my occupation, and matters were soon on a
      friendly footing. Indeed I may say at once that the stately
      college don we have heard so much about never made his
      appearance during our intercourse with him.<br>
      <br>
      He did not talk "Alice," of course; authors don't generally
      <i>talk</i> their books, I imagine; but it was undoubtedly
      Lewis Carroll who was present with us.<br>
      <br>
      A portrait of Ellen Terry on the wall had attracted his
      attention, and one of the first questions he asked was, "Do
      you ever go to the theatre?" I explained that such things
      were done, occasionally, even among Quakers, but they were
      not considered quite orthodox.<br>
      <br>
      "Oh, well, then you will not be shocked, and I may venture
      to produce my photographs." And out into the hall he went,
      and soon returned with a little black bag containing
      character portraits of his child-friends, Isa and Nellie
      Bowman.<br>
      <br>
      "Isa used to be Alice until she grew too big," he said.
      "Nellie was one of the oyster&mdash;fairies, and Emsie, the tiny
      one of all, was the Dormouse."<br>
      <br>
      "When 'Alice' was first dramatised," he said, "the poem of
      the 'Walrus and the Carpenter' fell rather flat, for people
      did not know when it was finished, and did not clap in the
      right place; so I had to write a song for the ghosts of the
      oysters to sing, which made it all right."

    <blockquote>
      He was then on his way to London, to fetch Isa to stay with
      him at Eastbourne. She was evidently a great favourite, and
      had visited him before. Of that earlier time he said:&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      "When people ask me why I have never married, I tell them I
      have never met the young lady whom I could endure for a
      fortnight&mdash;but Isa and I got on so well together that I said
      I should keep her a month, the length of the honeymoon, and
      we didn't get tired of each other."<br>
      <br>
      Nellie afterwards joined her sister "for a few days," but
      the days spread to some weeks, for the poor little dormouse
      developed scarlet fever, and the elder children had to be
      kept out of harm's way until fear of infection was
      over.<br>
      <br>
      Of Emsie he had a funny little story to tell. He had taken
      her to the Aquarium, and they had been watching the seals
      coming up dripping out of the water. With a very pitiful
      look she turned to him and said, "Don't they give them any
      towels?" [The same little girl commiserated the bear,
      because it had got no tail.]<br>
      <br>
      Asked to stay to dinner, he assured us that he never took
      anything in the middle of the day but a glass of wine and a
      biscuit; but he would be happy to sit down with us, which
      he accordingly did and kindly volunteered to carve for us.
      His offer was gladly accepted, but the appearance of a
      rather diminutive piece of neck of mutton was somewhat of a
      puzzle to him. He had evidently never seen such a joint in
      his life before, and had frankly to confess that he did not
      know how to set about carving it. Directions only made
      things worse, and he bravely cut it to pieces in entirely
      the wrong fashion, relating meanwhile the story of a shy
      young man who had been asked to carve a fowl, the joints of
      which had been carefully wired together beforehand by his
      too attentive friends.<br>
      <br>
      The task and the story being both finished, our visitor
      gazed on the mangled remains, and remarked quaintly: "I
      think it is just as well I don't want anything, for I don't
      know where I should find it."<br>
      <br>
      At least one member of the party felt she could have
      managed matters better; but that was a point of very little
      consequence.<br>
      <br>
      A day or two after the first call came a note saying that
      he would be taking Isa home before long, and if we would
      like to see her he would stop on the way again.<br>
      <br>
      Of course we were only too delighted to have the
      opportunity, and, though the visit was postponed more than
      once, it did take place early in August, when he brought
      both Isa and Nellie up to town to see a performance of
      "Sweet Lavender." It is needless to remark that we took
      care, this time, to be provided with something at once
      substantial and carvable.<br>
      <br>
      The children were bright, healthy, happy and childlike
      little maidens, quite devoted to their good friend, whom
      they called "Uncle"; and very interesting it was to see
      them together.<br>
      <br>
      But he did not allow any undue liberties either, as a
      little incident showed.<br>
      <br>
      He had been describing a particular kind of collapsible
      tumbler, which you put in your pocket and carried with you
      for use on a railway journey.<br>
      <br>
      "There now," he continued, turning to the children, "I
      forgot to bring it with me after all."<br>
      "Oh Goosie," broke in Isa; "you've been talking about that
      tumbler for days, and now you have forgotten it."<br>
      He pulled himself up, and looked at her steadily with an
      air of grave reproof.<br>
      <br>
      Much abashed, she hastily substituted a very subdued
      "Uncle" for the objectionable "Goosie," and the matter
      dropped.<br>
      The principal anecdote on this occasion was about a dog
      which had been sent into the sea after sticks. He brought
      them back very properly for some time, and then there
      appeared to be a little difficulty, and he returned
      swimming in a very curious manner. On closer inspection it
      appeared that he had caught hold of his own tail by
      mistake, and was bringing it to land in triumph.<br>
      <br>
      This was told with the utmost gravity, and though we had
      been requested beforehand not to mention "Lewis Carroll's"
      books, the temptation was too strong. I could not help
      saying to the child next me&mdash;<br>
      <br>
      "That was like the Whiting, wasn't it?"<br>
      <br>
      Our visitor, however, took up the remark, and seemed quite
      willing to talk about it.<br>
      <br>
      "When I wrote that," he said, "I believed that whiting
      really did have their tails in their mouths, but I have
      since been told that fishmongers put the tail through the
      eye, not in the mouth at all."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He was not a very good carver, for Miss Bremer also
      describes a little difficulty he had&mdash;this time with the
      pastry: "An amusing incident occurred when he was at lunch
      with us. He was requested to serve some pastry, and, using
      a knife, as it was evidently rather hard, the knife
      penetrated the d'oyley beneath&mdash;and his consternation was
      extreme when he saw the slice of linen and lace he served
      as an addition to the tart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, I think, through her connection with the "Alice"
      play that Mr. Dodgson first came to know Miss Isa Bowman.
      Her childish friendship for him was one of the joys of his
      later years, and one of the last letters he wrote was
      addressed to her. The poem at the beginning of "Sylvie and
      Bruno" is an acrostic on her name&mdash;

      Every one has heard of Lewis Carroll's hatred of
      interviewers; the following letter to Miss Manners makes
      one feel that in some cases, at least, his feeling was
      justifiable:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      If your Manchester relatives ever go to the play, tell them
      they ought to see Isa as "Cinderella"&mdash;she is evidently a
      success. And she has actually been "interviewed" by one of
      those dreadful newspapers reporters, and the "interview" is
      published with her picture! And such rubbish he makes her
      talk! She tells him that something or other was "tacitly
      conceded": and that "I love to see a great actress give
      expression to the wonderful ideas of the immortal
      master!"<br>
      <br>
      (N.B.&mdash;I never let her talk like that when she is with
      <i>me</i>!)<br>
      <br>
      Emsie recovered in time to go to America, with her mother
      and Isa and Nellie: and they all enjoyed the trip much; and
      Emsie has a London engagement.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Only once was an interviewer bold enough to enter Lewis
      Carroll's <i>sanctum</i>. The story has been told in <i>The
      Guardian</i> (January 19, 1898), but will bear repetition:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Not long ago Mr. Dodgson happened to get into
      correspondence with a man whom he had never seen, on some
      question of religious difficulty, and he invited him to
      come to his rooms and have a talk on the subject. When,
      therefore, a Mr. X&mdash; was announced to him one morning, he
      advanced to meet him with outstretched hand and smiles of
      welcome. "Come in Mr. X&mdash;, I have been expecting you." The
      delighted visitor thought this a promising beginning, and
      immediately pulled out a note-book and pencil, and
      proceeded to ask "the usual questions." Great was Mr.
      Dodgson's disgust! Instead of his expected friend, here was
      another man of the same name, and one of the much-dreaded
      interviewers, actually sitting in his chair! The mistake
      was soon explained, and the representative of the Press was
      bowed out as quickly as he had come in.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It was while Isa and one of her sisters were staying at
      Eastbourne that the visit to America was mooted. Mr.
      Dodgson suggested that it would be well for them to grow
      gradually accustomed to seafaring, and therefore proposed
      to take them by steamer to Hastings. This plan was carried
      out, and the weather was unspeakably bad&mdash;far worse than
      anything they experienced in their subsequent trip across
      the Atlantic. The two children, who were neither of them
      very good sailors, experienced sensations that were the
      reverse of pleasant. Mr. Dodgson did his best to console
      them, while he continually repeated, "Crossing the Atlantic
      will be much worse than this."
    </p>
    <p>
      However, even this terrible lesson on the horrors of the
      sea did not act as a deterrent; it was as unsuccessful as
      the effort of the old lady in one of his stories: "An old
      lady I once knew tried to check the military ardour of a
      little boy by showing him a picture of a battlefield, and
      describing some of its horrors. But the only answer she got
      was, 'I'll be a soldier. Tell it again!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bowman children sometimes came over to visit him at
      Oxford, and he used to delight in showing them over the
      colleges, and pointing out the famous people whom they
      encountered. On one of these occasions he was walking with
      Maggie, then a mere child, when they met the Bishop of
      Oxford, to whom Mr. Dodgson introduced his little guest.
      His lordship asked her what she thought of Oxford. "I
      think," said the little actress, with quite a professional
      <i>aplomb,</i> "it's the best place in the Provinces!" At
      which the Bishop was much amused. After the child had
      returned to town, the Bishop sent her a copy of a little
      book called "Golden Dust," inscribed "From W. Oxon," which
      considerably mystified her, as she knew nobody of that
      name!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another little stage-friend of Lewis Carroll's was Miss
      Vera Beringer, the "Little Lord Fauntleroy," whose acting
      delighted all theatre-goers eight or nine years ago. Once,
      when she was spending a holiday in the Isle of Man, he sent
      her the following lines:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4">There was a young lady of
    station,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">"I love man" was her sole
    exclamation;</span><br>
    <span class="c5">But when men cried, "You
    flatter,"</span><br>
    <span class="c5">She replied, "Oh! no matter,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">Isle of Man is the true
    explanation."</span><br>
    <p>
      Many of his friendships with children began in a railway
      carriage, for he always took about with him a stock of
      puzzles when he travelled, to amuse any little companions
      whom chance might send him. Once he was in a carriage with
      a lady and her little daughter, both complete strangers to
      him. The child was reading "Alice in Wonderland," and when
      she put her book down, he began talking to her about it.
      The mother soon joined in the conversation, of course
      without the least idea who the stranger was with whom she
      was talking. "Isn't it sad," she said, "about poor Mr.
      Lewis Carroll? He's gone mad, you know." "Indeed," replied
      Mr. Dodgson, "I had never heard that." "Oh, I assure you it
      is quite true," the lady answered. "I have it on the best
      authority." Before Mr. Dodgson parted with her, he obtained
      her leave to send a present to the little girl, and a few
      days afterwards she received a copy of "Through the
      Looking-Glass," inscribed with her name, and "From the
      Author, in memory of a pleasant journey."

      When he gave books to children, he very often wrote
      acrostics on their names on the fly-leaf. One of the
      prettiest was inscribed in a copy of Miss Yonge's "Little
      Lucy's Wonderful Globe," which he gave to Miss Ruth Dymes:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4">R ound the wondrous globe I wander
    wild,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">U p and down-hill&mdash;Age succeeds to
    youth&mdash;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">T oiling all in vain to find a
    child</span><br>
    <span class="c4">H alf so loving, half so dear as
    Ruth.</span><br>
    <p>
      In another book, given to her sister Margaret, he wrote:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4">M aidens, if a maid you meet</span><br>
    <span class="c4">A lways free from pout and pet,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">R eady smile and temper sweet,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">G reet my little Margaret.</span><br>
    <span class="c4">A nd if loved by all she be</span><br>
    <span class="c4">R ightly, not a pampered pet,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">E asily you then may see</span><br>
    <span class="c4">'Tis my little Margaret.</span><br>

      Here are two letters to children, the one interesting as a
      specimen of pure nonsense of the sort which children always
      like, the other as showing his dislike of being praised.
      The first was written to Miss Gertrude Atkinson, daughter
      of an old College friend, but otherwise unknown to Lewis
      Carroll except by her photograph:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Gertrude,&mdash;So many things have happened since we met
      last, really I don't know <i>which</i> to begin talking
      about! For instance, England has been conquered by William
      the Conqueror. We haven't met since <i>that</i> happened,
      you know. How did you like it? Were you frightened?<br>
      <br>
      And one more thing has happened: I have got your
      photograph. Thank you very much for it. I like it
      "awfully." Do they let you say "awfully"? or do they say,
      "No, my dear; little girls mustn't say 'awfully'; they
      should say 'very much indeed'"?<br>
      <br>
      I wonder if you will ever get as far as Jersey? If not, how
      <i>are</i> we to meet?<br>
      <br>
      Your affectionate friend,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From the second letter, to Miss Florence Jackson, I take
      the following extract:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I have two reasons for sending you this fable; one is, that
      in a letter you wrote me you said something about my being
      "clever"; and the other is that, when you wrote again you
      said it again! And <i>each</i> time I thought, "Really, I
      <i>must</i> write and ask her <i>not</i> to say such
      things; it is not wholesome reading for me."<br>
      <br>
      The fable is this. The cold, frosty, bracing air is the
      treatment one gets from the world generally&mdash;such as
      contempt, or blame, or neglect; all those are very
      wholesome. And the hot dry air, that you breathe when you
      rush to the fire, is the praise that one gets from one's
      young, happy, rosy, I may even say <i>florid</i> friends!
      And that's very bad for me, and gives pride-fever, and
      conceit-cough, and such-like diseases. Now I'm sure you
      don't want me to be laid up with all these diseases; so
      please don't praise me <i>any</i> more!
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The verses to "Matilda Jane" certainly deserve a place in
      this chapter. To make their meaning clear, I must state
      that Lewis Carroll wrote them for a little cousin of his,
      and that Matilda Jane was the somewhat prosaic name of her
      doll. The poem expresses finely the blind, unreasoning
      devotion which the infant mind professes for inanimate
      objects:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4">Matilda Jane, you never look</span><br>
    <span class="c4">At any toy or picture-book;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">I show you pretty things in vain,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">You must be blind, Matilda Jane!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c4">I ask you riddles, tell you
    tales,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">But all our conversation fails;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">You never answer me again,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">I fear you're dumb, Matilda Jane!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c4">Matilda, darling, when I call</span><br>
    <span class="c4">You never seem to hear at all;</span><br>
    <span class="c4">I shout with all my might and
    main,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">But you're <i>so</i> deaf, Matilda
    Jane!</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="c4">Matilda Jane, you needn't mind,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">For though you're deaf, and dumb, and
    blind,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">There's some one loves you, it is
    plain,</span><br>
    <span class="c4">And that is <i>me</i>, Matilda
    Jane!</span><br>
    <p>
      In an earlier chapter I gave some of Mr. Dodgson's letters
      to Miss Edith Rix; the two which follow, being largely
      about children, seem more appropriate here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Edith,&mdash;Would you tell your mother I was aghast at
      seeing the address of her letter to me: and I would much
      prefer "Rev. C.L. Dodgson, Ch. Ch., Oxford." When a letter
      comes addressed "Lewis Carroll, Ch. Ch.," it either goes to
      the Dead Letter Office, or it impresses on the minds of all
      letter-carriers, &amp;c., through whose hands it goes, the
      very fact I least want them to know.<br>
      <br>
      Please offer to your sister all the necessary apologies for
      the liberty I have taken with her name. My only excuse is,
      that I know no other; and how <i>am</i> I to guess what the
      full name is? It <i>may</i> be Carlotta, or Zealot, or
      Ballot, or Lotus-blossom (a very pretty name), or even
      Charlotte. Never have I sent anything to a young lady of
      whom I have a more shadowy idea. Name, an enigma; age,
      somewhere between 1 and 19 (you've no idea how bewildering
      it is, alternately picturing her as a little toddling thing
      of 5, and a tall girl of 15!); disposition&mdash;well, I
      <i>have</i> a fragment of information on <i>that</i>
      question&mdash;your mother says, as to my coming, "It must be
      when Lottie is at home, or she would never forgive us."
      Still, I <i>cannot</i> consider the mere fact that she is
      of an unforgiving disposition as a complete view of her
      character. I feel sure she has some other qualities
      besides.<br>
      <br>
      Believe me,<br>
      <br>
      Yrs affectionately,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      My dear child,&mdash;It seems quite within the bounds of
      possibility, if we go on long in this style, that our
      correspondence may at last assume a really friendly tone. I
      don't of course say it will actually do so&mdash;that would be
      too bold a prophecy, but only that it may tend to shape
      itself in that direction.<br>
      <br>
      Your remark, that slippers for elephants <i>could</i> be
      made, only they would not be slippers, but boots, convinces
      me that there is a branch of your family in <i>Ireland</i>.
      Who are (oh dear, oh dear, I am going distracted! There's a
      lady in the opposite house who simply sings <i>all</i> day.
      All her songs are wails, and their tunes, such as they
      have, are much the same. She has one strong note in her
      voice, and she knows it! I <i>think</i> it's "A natural,"
      but I haven't much ear. And when she gets to that note, she
      howls!) they? The O'Rixes, I suppose?<br>
      <br>
      About your uninteresting neighbours, I sympathise with you
      much; but oh, I wish I had you here, that I might teach you
      <i>not</i> to say "It is difficult to visit one's district
      regularly, like every one else does!"<br>
      <br>
      And now I come to the most interesting part of your
      letter&mdash;May you treat me as a perfect friend, and write
      anything you like to me, and ask my advice? Why, <i>of
      course</i> you may, my child! What else am I good for? But
      oh, my dear child-friend, you cannot guess how such words
      sound to <i>me</i>! That any one should look up to
      <i>me</i>, or think of asking <i>my</i> advice&mdash;well, it
      makes one feel humble, I think, rather than proud&mdash;humble to
      remember, while others think so well of me, what I really
      <i>am</i>, in myself. "Thou, that teachest another,
      teachest thou not thyself?" Well, I won't talk about
      myself, it is not a healthy topic. Perhaps it may be true
      of <i>any</i> two people, that, if one could see the other
      through and through, love would perish. I don't know.
      Anyhow, I like to <i>have</i> the love of my child-friends,
      tho' I know I don't deserve it. Please write as freely as
      <i>ever</i> you like.<br>
      <br>
      I went up to town and fetched Phoebe down here on Friday in
      last week; and we spent <i>most</i> of Saturday upon the
      beach&mdash;Phoebe wading and digging, and "as happy as a bird
      upon the wing" (to quote the song she sang when first I saw
      her). Tuesday evening brought a telegram to say she was
      wanted at the theatre next morning. So, instead of going to
      bed, Phoebe packed her things, and we left by the last
      train, reaching her home by a quarter to 1 a.m. However,
      even four days of sea-air, and a new kind of happiness, did
      her good, I think. I am rather lonely now she is gone. She
      is a very sweet child, and a thoughtful child, too. It was
      very touching to see (we had a little Bible-reading every
      day: I tried to remember that my little friend had a soul
      to be cared for, as well as a body) the far-away look in
      her eyes, when we talked of God and of heaven&mdash;as if her
      angel, who beholds His face continually, were whispering to
      her.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, there isn't <i>much</i> companionship possible,
      after all, between an old man's mind and a little child's,
      but what there is is sweet&mdash;and wholesome, I think.

      Three letters of his to a child-friend, Miss Kathleen
      Eschwege, now Mrs. Round, illustrate one of those
      friendships which endure: the sort of friendship that he
      always longed for, and so often failed to secure:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Ch. Ch., Oxford,<br>
      <i>October</i> 24, 1879.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Kathleen,&mdash;I was really pleased to get your letter,
      as I had quite supposed I should never see or hear of you
      again. You see I knew only your Christian name&mdash;not the
      ghost of a surname, or the shadow of an address&mdash;and I was
      not prepared to spend my little all in advertisements&mdash;"If
      the young lady, who was travelling on the G.W. Railway,
      &amp;c." &mdash;or to devote the remainder of my life to going
      about repeating "Kathleen," like that young woman who came
      from some foreign land to look for her lover, but only knew
      that he was called "Edward" (or "Richard" was it? I dare
      say you know History better than I do) and that he lived in
      England; so that naturally it took her some time to find
      him. All I knew was that <i>you</i> could, if you chose,
      write to me through Macmillan: but it is three months since
      we met, so I was <i>not</i> expecting it, and it was a
      pleasant surprise.<br>
      <br>
      Well, so I hope I may now count you as one of my
      child-friends. I am fond of children (except boys), and
      have more child-friends than I could possibly count on my
      fingers, even if I were a centipede (by the way,
      <i>have</i> they fingers? I'm afraid they're only feet,
      but, of course, they use them for the same purpose, and
      that is why no other insects, <i>except centipedes</i>,
      ever succeed in doing <i>Long Multiplication</i>), and I
      have several not so very far from you&mdash;one at Beckenham, two
      at Balham, two at Herne Hill, one at Peckham&mdash;so there is
      every chance of my being somewhere near you <i>before the
      year</i> 1979. If so, may I call? I am <i>very</i> sorry
      your neck is no better, and I wish they would take you to
      Margate: Margate air will make <i>any</i> body well of
      <i>any</i> thing.<br>
      <br>
      It seems you have already got my two books about "Alice."
      Have you also got "The Hunting of the Snark"? If not, I
      should be very glad to send you one. The pictures (by Mr.
      Holiday) are pretty: and you needn't read the verses unless
      you like.<br>
      <br>
      How do you pronounce your surname? "esk-weej"? or how? Is
      it a German name?<br>
      <br>
      If you can do "Doublets," with how many links do you turn
      KATH into LEEN?<br>
      <br>
      With kind remembrances to your mother, I am<br>
      <br>
      Your affectionate friend,<br>
      <br>
      Charles L. Dodgson<br>
      <br>
      (<i>alias</i> "Lewis Carroll").<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., Oxford,<br>
      <i>January</i> 20, 1892.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Kathleen,&mdash;Some months ago I heard, from my cousin,
      May Wilcox, that you were engaged to be married. And, ever
      since, I have cherished the intention of writing to offer
      my congratulations. Some might say, "Why not write <i>at
      once?"</i> To such unreasoning creatures, the obvious reply
      is, "When you have bottled some peculiarly fine Port, do
      you usually begin to drink it <i>at once?"</i> Is not that
      a beautiful simile? Of course, I need not remark that my
      congratulations are like fine old Port&mdash;only finer, and
      <i>older!</i><br>
      <br>
      Accept, my dear old friend, my <i>heartiest</i> wishes for
      happiness, of all sorts and sizes, for yourself, and for
      him whom you have chosen as your other self. And may you
      love one another with a love second only to your love for
      God&mdash;a love that will last through bright days and dark
      days, in sickness and in health, through life and through
      death.<br>
      <br>
      A few years ago I went, in the course of about three
      months, to the weddings of three of my old child-friends.
      But weddings are not very exhilarating scenes for a
      miserable old bachelor; and I think you'll have to excuse
      me from attending <i>yours</i>.<br>
      <br>
      However, I have so far concerned myself in it that I
      actually <i>dreamed</i> about it a few nights ago! I
      dreamed that you had had a photograph done of the
      wedding&mdash;party, and had sent me a copy of it. At one side
      stood a group of ladies, among whom I made out the faces of
      Dolly and Ninty; and in the foreground, seated in a boat,
      were two people, a gentleman and a lady I <i>think</i>
      (could they have been the bridegroom and the bride?)
      engaged in the natural and usual occupation for a riverside
      picnic&mdash;pulling a Christmas cracker! I have no idea what put
      such an idea into my head. <i>I</i> never saw crackers used
      in such a scene!<br>
      <br>
      I hope your mother goes on well. With kindest regards to
      her and your father, and love to your sisters&mdash;and to
      yourself too, if HE doesn't object!&mdash;I am,<br>
      <br>
      Yours affectionately,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.<br>
      <br>
      P.S.&mdash;I never give wedding-presents; so please regard the
      enclosed as an <i>unwedding</i> present.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Ch. Ch., Oxford,<br>
      <i>December</i> 8, 1897.<br>
      <br>
      My dear Kathleen,&mdash;Many thanks for the photo of yourself and
      your <i>fianc&#233;</i>, which duly reached me January
      23, 1892. Also for a wedding-card, which reached me August
      28, 1892. Neither of these favours, I fear, was ever
      acknowledged. Our only communication since, has been, that
      on December 13, 1892, I sent you a biscuit&mdash;box adorned with
      "Looking-Glass" pictures. This <i>you</i> never
      acknowledged; so I was properly served for my negligence. I
      hope your little daughter, of whose arrival Mrs. Eschwege
      told me in December, 1893, has been behaving well? How
      quickly the years slip by! It seems only yesterday that I
      met, on the railway, a little girl who was taking a sketch
      of Oxford!<br>
      <br>
      Your affectionate old friend,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.

      The following verses were inscribed in a copy of "Alice's
      Adventures," presented to the three Miss Drurys in August,
      1869:&mdash;
    </p><span class="c4"><i>To three puzzled little girls, from

    <span class="c4">Three little maidens weary of the
    rail,</span><br>

      He took the same three children to German Reed's
      entertainment, where the triple bill consisted of "Happy
      Arcadia," "All Abroad," and "Very Catching." A few days
      afterwards he sent them "Phantasmagoria," with a little
      poem on the fly-leaf to remind them of their treat:&mdash;

    <span class="c5">A <i>very catching</i> prize.</span><br>
    <p>
      The next three letters were addressed to two of Mr. Arthur
      Hughes' children. They are good examples of the wild and
      delightful nonsense with which Lewis Carroll used to amuse
      his little friends:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      My dear Agnes,&mdash;You lazy thing! What? I'm to divide the
      kisses myself, am I? Indeed I won't take the trouble to do
      anything of the sort! But I'll tell <i>you</i> how to do
      it. First, you must take <i>four</i> of the kisses, and&mdash;and
      that reminds me of a very curious thing that happened to me
      at half-past four yesterday. Three visitors came knocking
      at my door, begging me to let them in. And when I opened
      the door, who do you think they were? You'll never guess.
      Why, they were three cats! Wasn't it curious? However, they
      all looked so cross and disagreeable that I took up the
      first thing I could lay my hand on (which happened to be
      the rolling-pin) and knocked them all down as flat as
      pan-cakes! "If <i>you</i> come knocking at <i>my</i> door,"
      I said, "<i>I</i> shall come knocking at <i>your</i>
      heads." "That was fair, wasn't it?"<br>
      <br>
      Yours affectionately,<br>
      <br>
      Lewis Carroll.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      My dear Agnes,&mdash;About the cats, you know. Of course I didn't
      leave them lying flat on the ground like dried flowers: no,
      I picked them up, and I was as kind as I could be to them.
      I lent them the portfolio for a bed&mdash;they wouldn't have been
      comfortable in a real bed, you know: they were too thin&mdash;but
      they were <i>quite</i> happy between the sheets of
      blotting-paper&mdash;and each of them had a pen-wiper for a
      pillow. Well, then I went to bed: but first I lent them the
      three dinner-bells, to ring if they wanted anything in the
      night.<br>
      <br>
      You know I have <i>three</i> dinner-bells&mdash;the first (which
      is the largest) is rung when dinner is <i>nearly</i> ready;
      the second (which is rather larger) is rung when it is
      quite ready; and the third (which is as large as the other
      two put together) is rung all the time I am at dinner.
      Well, I told them they might ring if they happened to want
      anything&mdash;and, as they rang <i>all</i> the bells <i>all</i>
      night, I suppose they did want something or other, only I
      was too sleepy to attend to them.<br>
      <br>
      In the morning I gave them some rat-tail jelly and buttered
      mice for breakfast, and they were as discontented as they
      could be. They wanted some boiled pelican, but of course I
      knew it wouldn't be good <i>for</i> them. So all I said was
      "Go to Number Two, Finborough Road, and ask for Agnes
      Hughes, and if it's <i>really</i> good for you, she'll give
      you some." Then I shook hands with them all, and wished
      them all goodbye, and drove them up the chimney. They
      seemed very sorry to go, and they took the bells and the
      portfolio with them. I didn't find this out till after they
      had gone, and then I was sorry too, and wished for them
      back again. What do I mean by "them"? Never mind.<br>
      <br>
      How are Arthur, and Amy, and Emily? Do they still go up and
      down Finborough Road, and teach the cats to be kind to
      mice? I'm <i>very</i> fond of all the cats in Finborough
      Road.<br>
      <br>
      Give them my love.<br>
      Who do I mean by "them"?<br>
      Never mind.<br>
      <br>
      Your affectionate friend,<br>
      <br>

      My dear Amy,&mdash;How are you getting on, I wonder, with
      guessing those puzzles from "Wonderland"? If you think
      you've found out any of the answers, you may send them to
      me; and if they're wrong, I won't tell you they're
      right!<br>
      <br>
      You asked me after those three cats. Ah! The dear
      creatures! Do you know, ever since that night they first
      came, they have <i>never left me?</i> Isn't it kind of
      them? Tell Agnes this. She will be interested to hear it.
      And they <i>are</i> so kind and thoughtful! Do you know,
      when I had gone out for a walk the other day, they got
      <i>all</i> my books out of the bookcase, and opened them on
      the floor, to be ready for me to read. They opened them all
      at page 50, because they thought that would be a nice
      useful page to begin at. It was rather unfortunate, though:
      because they took my bottle of gum, and tried to gum
      pictures upon the ceiling (which they thought would please
      me), and by accident they spilt a quantity of it all over
      the books. So when they were shut up and put by, the leaves
      all stuck together, and I can never read page 50 again in
      any of them!<br>
      <br>
      However, they meant it very kindly, so I wasn't angry. I
      gave them each a spoonful of ink as a treat; but they were
      ungrateful for that, and made dreadful faces. But, of
      course, as it was given them as a treat, they had to drink
      it. One of them has turned black since: it was a white cat
      to begin with.<br>
      <br>
      Give my love to any children you happen to meet. Also I
      send two kisses and a half, for you to divide with Agnes,
      Emily, and Godfrey. Mind you divide them fairly.<br>

      The intelligent reader will make a discovery about the
      first of the two following letters, which Miss Maggie
      Cunningham, the "child-friend" to whom both were addressed,
      perhaps did not hit upon at once. Mr. Dodgson wrote these
      two letters in 1868:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dear Maggie,&mdash;I found that <i>the friend,</i> that the
      little girl asked me to write to, lived at Ripon, and not
      at Land's End&mdash;a nice sort of place to invite to! It looked
      rather suspicious to me&mdash;and soon after, by dint of
      incessant inquiries, I found out that <i>she</i> was called
      Maggie, and lived in a Crescent! Of course I declared,
      "After that" (the language I used doesn't matter), "I will
      <i>not</i> address her, that's flat! So do not expect me to
      flatter."<br>
      <br>
      Well, I hope you will soon see your beloved Pa come
      back&mdash;for consider, should you be quite content with only
      Jack? Just suppose they made a blunder! (Such things happen
      now and then.) Really, now, I shouldn't wonder if your
      "John" came home again, and your father stayed at school! A
      most awkward thing, no doubt. How would you receive him?
      You'll say, perhaps, "you'd turn him out." That would
      answer well, so far as concerns the boy, you know&mdash;but
      consider your Papa, learning lessons in a row of great inky
      schoolboys! This (though unlikely) might occur: "Haly"
      would be grieved to miss him (don't mention it to
      <i>her</i>).<br>
      <br>
      No <i>carte</i> has yet been done of me, that does real
      justice to my <i>smile</i>; and so I hardly like, you see,
      to send you one. However, I'll consider if I will or
      not&mdash;meanwhile, I send a little thing to give you an idea of
      what I look like when I'm lecturing. The merest sketch, you
      will allow&mdash;yet still I think there's something grand in the
      expression of the brow and in the action of the hand.<br>
      <br>
      Have you read my fairy tale in <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine?</i>
      If you have you will not fail to discover what I mean when
      I say "Bruno yesterday came to remind me that <i>he</i> was
      my god-son!"&mdash;on the ground that I "gave him a name"!<br>
      <br>
      Your affectionate friend,<br>
      <br>
      C.L. Dodgson.<br>
      <br>
      P.S.&mdash;I would send, if I were not too shy, the same message
      to "Haly" that she (though I do not deserve it, not I!) has
      sent through her sister to me. My best love to yourself&mdash;to
      your Mother my kindest regards&mdash;to your small, fat,
      impertinent, ignorant brother my hatred. I think that is
      all.

      I hope you won't leave off writing to me on that account. I
      got the little book safe, and will do my best about putting
      my name in, if I can only manage to remember what day my
      birthday is&mdash;but one forgets these things so easily.<br>

      <br>
      "Mr. Dodgson presents his compliments to her Majesty, and
      regrets to say that his rule is never to give his
      photograph except to <i>young</i> ladies." I am told she
      was annoyed about it, and said, "I'm not so old as all that
      comes to!" and one doesn't like to annoy Queens; but really
      I couldn't help it, you know.

    <br>
    <p>
      I will conclude this chapter with some reminiscences of
      Lewis Carroll, which have been kindly sent me by an old
      child-friend of his, Mrs. Maitland, daughter of the late
      Rev. E.A. Litton, Rector of Naunton, and formerly Fellow of
      Oriel College and Vice&mdash;Principal of Saint Edmund's Hall:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      To my mind Oxford will be never quite the same again now
      that so many of the dear old friends of one's childhood
      have "gone over to the great majority."<br>
      <br>
      Often, in the twilight, when the flickering firelight
      danced on the old wainscotted wall, have we&mdash;father and
      I&mdash;chatted over the old Oxford days and friends, and the
      merry times we all had together in Long Wall Street. I was
      a nervous, thin, remarkably ugly child then, and for some
      years I was left almost entirely to the care of Mary
      Pearson, my own particular attendant. I first remember Mr.
      Dodgson when I was about seven years old, and from that
      time until we went to live in Gloucestershire he was one of
      my most delightful friends.<br>
      <br>
      I shall never forget how Mr. Dodgson and I sat once under a
      dear old tree in the Botanical Gardens, and how he told me,
      for the first time, Hans Andersen's story of the "Ugly
      Duckling." I cannot explain the charm of Mr. Dodgson's way
      of telling stories; as he spoke, the characters seemed to
      be real flesh and blood. This particular story made a great
      impression upon me, and interested me greatly, as I was
      very sensitive about my ugly little self. I remember his
      impressing upon me that it was better to be good and
      truthful and to try not to think of oneself than to be a
      pretty, selfish child, spoiled and disagreeable; and, after
      telling me this story, he gave me the name of "Ducky."
      "Never mind, little Ducky," he used often to say, "perhaps
      some day you will turn out a swan."<br>
      <br>
      I always attribute my love for animals to the teaching of
      Mr. Dodgson: his stories about them, his knowledge of their
      lives and histories, his enthusiasm about birds and
      butterflies enlivened many a dull hour. The monkeys in the
      Botanical Gardens were our special pets, and when we fed
      them with nuts and biscuits he seemed to enjoy the fun as
      much as I did.<br>
      <br>
      Every day my nurse and I used to take a walk in Christ
      Church Meadows, and often we would sit down on the soft
      grass, with the dear old Broad Walk quite close, and, when
      we raised our eyes, Merton College, with its walls covered
      with Virginian creeper. And how delighted we used to be to
      see the well-known figure in cap and gown coming, so
      swiftly, with his kind smile ready to welcome the "Ugly
      Duckling." I knew, as he sat beside me, that a book of
      fairy tales was hidden in his pocket, or that he would have
      some new game or puzzle to show me&mdash;and he would gravely
      accept a tiny daisy-bouquet for his coat with as much
      courtesy as if it had been the finest hot-house
      <i>boutonni&#232;re</i>.<br>
      <br>
      Two or three times I went fishing with him from the bank
      near the Old Mill, opposite Addison's Walk, and he quite
      entered into my happiness when a small fish came wriggling
      up at the end of my bent pin, just ready for the dinner of
      the little white kitten "Lily," which he had given me.<br>
      <br>
      My hair was a great trouble to me, as a child, for it would
      tangle, and Mary was not too patient with me, as I twisted
      about while she was trying to dress it. One day I received
      a long blue envelope addressed to myself, which contained a
      story-letter, full of drawings, from Mr. Dodgson. The first
      picture was of a little girl&mdash;with her hat off and her
      tumbled hair very much in evidence&mdash;asleep on a rustic bench
      under a big tree by the riverside, and two birds, holding
      what was evidently a very important conversation, above in
      the branches, their heads on one side, eyeing the sleeping
      child. Then there was a picture of the birds flying up to
      the child with twigs and straw in their beaks, preparing to
      build their nest in her hair. Next came the awakening, with
      the nest completed, and the mother-bird sitting on it;
      while the father-bird flew round the frightened child. And
      then, lastly, hundreds of birds&mdash;the air thick with them&mdash;the
      child fleeing, small boys with tin trumpets raised to their
      lips to add to the confusion, and Mary, armed with a basket
      of brushes and combs, bringing up the rear! After this,
      whenever I was restive while my hair was being arranged,
      Mary would show me the picture of the child with the nest
      on her head, and I at once became "as quiet as a lamb."<br>
      <br>
      I had a daily governess, a dear old soul, who used to come
      every morning to teach me. I disliked particularly the
      large&mdash;lettered copies which she used to set me; and as I
      confided this to Mr. Dodgson, he came and gave me some
      copies himself. The only ones which I can remember were
      "Patience and water-gruel cure gout" (I always wondered
      what "gout" might be) and "Little girls should be seen and
      not heard" (which I thought unkind). These were written
      many times over, and I had to present the pages to him,
      without one blot or smudge, at the end of the week.<br>
      <br>
      One of the Fellows of Magdalen College at that time was a
      Mr. Saul, a friend of my father's and of Mr. Dodgson, and a
      great lover of music&mdash;his rooms were full of musical
      instruments of every sort. Mr. Dodgson and father and I all
      went one afternoon to pay him a visit. At that time he was
      much interested in the big drum, and we found him when we
      arrived in full practice, with his music-book open before
      him. He made us all join in the concert. Father undertook
      the 'cello, and Mr. Dodgson hunted up a comb and some
      paper, and, amidst much fun and laughter, the walls echoed
      with the finished roll, or shake, of the big drum&mdash;a roll
      that was Mr. Saul's delight.<br>
      <br>
      My father died on August 27, 1897, and Mr. Dodgson on
      January 14, 1898. And we, who are left behind in this cold,
      weary world can only hope we may some day meet them again.
      Till then, oh! Father, and my dear old childhood's friend,
      <i>requiescalis in pace!</i>

        This Rectory has been supposed to have been built in the
        time of Edward VI., but recent discoveries clearly assign
        its origin to a much earlier period. A stone has been
        found in an island formed by the river Tees on which is
        inscribed the letter "A," which is justly conjectured to
        stand for the name of the great King Alfred, in whose
        reign this house was probably built.

Proofreaders


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
